2025-09-08 09:59:28,767 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the initial tonal center from the opening harmony/melody.
Step 2: Scan the excerpt for a sustained shift to a new tonal center. Listen for cadential motion into a new key and a stable leading-tone/scale pattern supporting that key.
Step 3: The music does not establish and maintain a new tonal center. It remains in the original key.
Step 4: Final Answer
B. No, the key stays the same.
