2025-09-05 19:17:33,718 - [COT/GroupA] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melody starts at a lower pitch and consistently moves to higher pitches, with the final note being significantly higher than the initial note. There are no major peaks followed by a fall, or troughs followed by a rise.
Step 2: The global trend is a continuous upward movement in pitch from start to end. This fits the definition of Ascending.

2025-09-05 19:17:37,263 - [COT/GroupA] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melody begins at a relatively high pitch and consistently moves to lower pitches throughout its duration, ending at a significantly lower point than where it started. There is no clear peak followed by a descent or trough followed by an ascent.
Step 2: The global trend is an overall downward movement in pitch from the beginning to the end. This fits the definition of Descending.
D. Descending (pitch falls over time)
2025-09-05 19:17:37,263 - Parsed Final Answer: D. Descending (pitch falls over time)

Step 2: The global trend indicates a clear overall upward movement in pitch.
C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:17:41,191 - Parsed Final Answer: C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
