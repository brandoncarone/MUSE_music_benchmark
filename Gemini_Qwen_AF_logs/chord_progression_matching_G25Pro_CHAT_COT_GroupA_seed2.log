2025-09-07 15:34:48,245 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, I will determine the chord progression in Roman numerals.
- Excerpt 1 is a fast rock piece. The chord progression, relative to its key (A major), is F#m–D–A–E. Functionally, this is vi–IV–I–V. This cycle repeats.
- Excerpt 2 is a slower piece with clean electric guitar. The chord progression, relative to its key (G major), is G–C–D–Em. Functionally, this is I–IV–V–vi. This cycle also repeats.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1: vi–IV–I–V
- Progression 2: I–IV–V–vi
Although both progressions use the same four chords (tonic, subdominant, dominant, and submediant), their order is different.

Step 3: Apply the decision rule.
Since the order of the harmonic functions is different, the two excerpts do not share the same underlying chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:34:48,245 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will determine the chord progression in Roman numerals.
- Excerpt 1 is a piano-led piece in the key of C major. The chords follow the sequence C major – A minor – F major – G major. In functional terms, this is a I–vi–IV–V progression.
- Excerpt 2 is a guitar-led piece in the key of G major. The chords follow the sequence G major – E minor – C major – D major. In functional terms, this is also a I–vi–IV–V progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1: I–vi–IV–V
- Progression 2: I–vi–IV–V
The two progressions share the exact same sequence of harmonic functions.

Step 3: Apply the decision rule.
Since the functional order is identical, the two excerpts share the same underlying chord progression, despite differences in key, instrumentation, and style.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:37:14,686 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will determine the chord progression in Roman numerals.
- Excerpt 1 features a piano and rhythm section. The key is C major. The progression is C major – A minor – F major – G major. Functionally, this is I–vi–IV–V.
- Excerpt 2 is a heavy rock track. The key is A major. The progression is F# minor – D major – A major – E major. Functionally, this is vi–IV–I–V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1: I–vi–IV–V
- Progression 2: vi–IV–I–V
While both progressions use the same four chords (tonic, submediant, subdominant, and dominant), they are arranged in a different order.

Step 3: Apply the decision rule.
The order of the harmonic functions is different. Therefore, they are not the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will determine the chord progression in Roman numerals.
- Excerpt 1 is a funky piece with electric guitar. The key is G major. The chords follow the sequence G major – E minor – C major – D major. In functional terms, this is a I–vi–IV–V progression.
- Excerpt 2 is a piano-led pop-rock piece. The key is C major. The chords follow the sequence C major – G major – A minor – F major. In functional terms, this is a I–V–vi–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1: I–vi–IV–V
- Progression 2: I–V–vi–IV
While both progressions use the same set of four harmonic functions (tonic, dominant, submediant, subdominant), the order in which they appear is different.

Step 3: Apply the decision rule.
Since the order of the harmonic functions is different, the two excerpts do not share the same underlying chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will determine the chord progression in Roman numerals.
- Excerpt 1 is an acoustic guitar piece. The key center feels like G major. The chords follow the sequence Em–C–G–D. In the key of G major, this translates to a vi–IV–I–V progression.
- Excerpt 2 is a clean electric guitar piece with a band. The key is G major. The chords follow the sequence G–D–Em–C. This translates to a I–V–vi–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1: vi–IV–I–V
