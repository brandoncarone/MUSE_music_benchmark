2025-09-07 22:33:22,750 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins by establishing a clear major key with a repeating diatonic chord progression. The harmony cycles through what sounds like a I-IV-V-I progression, firmly grounding the listener in a single tonal center.

Step 2: The entire excerpt consists of this repeating harmonic pattern. There are no chromatic chords, no new leading tones, and no cadential phrases that would suggest a shift to a new key. The music consistently reinforces the initial tonal center from beginning to end.

Step 3: Since the music never leaves its original tonal center, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:22,750 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:22,750 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear and repeating chord progression, establishing a stable tonal center, likely in a minor key.

Step 2: The harmonic progression repeats identically throughout the entire excerpt. There are no chromatic alterations, new leading tones, or cadences that would indicate a shift to a new key. The music consistently reinforces the initial tonal center.

Step 3: Since the harmonic material is cyclical and never deviates from the established key, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:30,370 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:33:40,153 - [COT/GroupA] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a clear minor key, establishing a somber tonal center with a repeating chord progression.

Step 2: Around the 0:18 mark, the harmonic character shifts significantly. The music moves to a new section that is firmly established in a major key, which feels like the relative major of the original key. This new section has its own stable progression and feels like a new "home base."

Step 3: This shift is not a temporary tonicization; it's a sustained change in the tonal center that lasts for the remainder of the excerpt. A new key is clearly and stably established. Therefore, a modulation has occurred.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:33:40,153 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:33:40,153 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:33:51,013 - [COT/GroupA] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a clear minor key, established by a repeating arpeggiated chord progression. This initial section (from 0:00 to approximately 0:21) firmly sets the tonal center.

Step 2: At around 0:22, the harmony and overall mood of the piece shift dramatically. A new, brighter chord progression begins, which is clearly centered in a new major key (likely the relative major of the original key). This new section has its own stable harmonic progression and feels like a new "home base."

Step 3: This shift is sustained for the remainder of the excerpt, confirming that it is not a brief tonicization but a definite change of key. A new tonal center is established and maintained. Therefore, a modulation has occurred.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:33:51,013 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:33:51,013 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:33:59,613 - [COT/GroupA] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear chord progression played on electric guitars, establishing a tonal center in a minor key. The progression is cyclical and immediately sets a stable harmonic foundation.

Step 2: The entire excerpt consists of this same repeating four-chord progression. There are no new chords introduced that would suggest a shift in key. The harmony remains diatonic to the original key, and there is no cadential motion toward a new tonal center.

Step 3: The music stays firmly in one key from beginning to end. The lack of any harmonic deviation means no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:59,613 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:59,613 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:34:11,692 - [COT/GroupA] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear, repeating four-chord progression in a major key. This progression immediately establishes a stable and unambiguous tonal center.

Step 2: The entire piece consists of this same four-chord progression repeating without any alteration. There are no chromatic chords, secondary dominants, or any harmonic movement that would suggest a shift away from the original key. The melody and harmony consistently reinforce the initial tonal center.

Step 3: Since the harmonic material is static and cyclical, and the music never leaves the established home key, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:34:11,692 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:34:26,059 - [COT/GroupA] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear, repeating four-chord progression that establishes a stable major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The initial progression repeats several times. However, at approximately 0:17, the harmonic structure changes distinctly. A new chord progression begins that has a darker, minor quality. This new section feels centered on a new tonic, likely the relative minor of the original key.

Step 3: This new section is not a brief departure; it is sustained for the remainder of the excerpt and establishes a new stable "home base." This sustained shift to a new tonal center is a key modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:34:26,059 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:34:26,059 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:34:38,546 - [COT/GroupA] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt opens with a standard, repeating four-chord progression in a major key. This establishes a clear and stable tonal center from the beginning.

Step 2: The entire piece consists of this same four-chord loop repeating without any change. The harmony remains strictly diatonic to the original key. There are no chromatic chords, new leading tones, or cadences that suggest a move to a different key.

Step 3: The music stays firmly within its initial tonal center for the entire duration. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:34:38,546 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:34:38,546 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:34:52,323 - [COT/GroupA] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins by establishing a clear tonal center with a repeating chord progression.

Step 2: The music then moves through several different harmonic sections. While these sections use different chords and create a sense of journey or development, they do not establish a new stable key. Each new progression feels like it is leading to the next one, creating tension that is ultimately resolved when the music returns to the original chord progression towards the end of the excerpt. This entire sequence functions as an extended harmonic journey within the original key.

Step 3: The piece explores different harmonic areas but never settles into a new tonal center. Since the original key remains the ultimate point of reference and return, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:34:52,323 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:34:52,323 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:35:09,039 - [COT/GroupA] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with an energetic funk/rock progression that establishes a clear tonal center in a major key.

Step 2: The piece progresses through a series of distinct harmonic sections. Around 0:08, the harmony shifts to a new progression that feels centered on a different tonic. This new section is sustained and feels stable. Following this, the music moves through at least two more distinct harmonic areas (e.g., at 0:16 and 0:24), each establishing its own temporary tonal center. These are not brief passing chords but entire sections built on new harmonic foundations.

Step 3: Because the music clearly shifts and establishes at least one new, stable tonal center that is maintained for a significant duration, a modulation has occurred. In fact, the piece seems to modulate several times.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:35:09,039 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:35:09,039 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
