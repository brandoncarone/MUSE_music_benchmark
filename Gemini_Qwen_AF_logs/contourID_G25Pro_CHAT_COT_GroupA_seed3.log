2025-09-05 19:06:43,683 - Stimulus: file=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Ebmaj_Scale_Arch_Piano.wav
2025-09-05 19:06:48,194 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
The melody begins on a low note, rises systematically to a peak in the middle of the excerpt, and then descends in a similar fashion. This rise-then-fall pattern corresponds to an arch shape.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:06:48,194 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)

2025-09-05 19:07:15,336 - [COT/GroupA] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
The melody begins on a low note, climbs steadily to a peak in the middle, and then descends back to the starting pitch. This clear rise-then-fall motion defines an arch contour.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:07:15,336 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)

2025-09-05 19:07:23,180 - [COT/GroupA] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
The musical excerpt begins on a high pitch and moves progressively downward, ending on a much lower note. This consistent downward motion characterizes a descending contour.

D. Descending (pitch falls over time)
2025-09-05 19:07:23,180 - Parsed Final Answer: D. Descending (pitch falls over time)
2025-09-05 19:07:23,180 - Evaluation: Correct

2025-09-05 19:07:32,655 - [COT/GroupA] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
The melody starts on a high pitch, moves down to a low point, and then ascends toward the end. This "fall then rise" pattern is the definition of an inverted arch.

B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:07:32,655 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

The melody begins on a mid-range pitch, ascends to a clear high point, and then descends back to a lower pitch. This rise-then-fall motion perfectly describes an arch contour.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:07:46,740 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
