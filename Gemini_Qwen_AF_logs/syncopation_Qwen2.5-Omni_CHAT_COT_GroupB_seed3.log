Step 1: Both excerpts share a steady pulse.
Step 2: Excerpt 1 places all kick/snare hits on strong beats; the only off-beats present are the consistent eighth note hi-hat ostinatos.Excerpt 2 places several of the kick/snare hits on strong beats, but there are 6 instances where the kick/snare hits land on off-beats instead of strong beats.
Step 3: Excerpt 2 emphasizes more off-beats than Excerpt 1. Thus, Excerpt 2 is more syncopated.
B. The rhythm in Excerpt 2 is more syncopated.
