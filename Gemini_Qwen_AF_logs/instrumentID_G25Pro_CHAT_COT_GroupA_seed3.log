The audio excerpt features an instrument playing both a sustained chord and an arpeggiated melodic figure. The sound has a distinct percussive attack, created by what sounds like hammers hitting strings, followed by a long, rich, resonant decay. The instrument demonstrates a wide dynamic and pitch range. This combination of characteristics is the signature sound of a piano.

The sound is a melodic line with a bright, clear timbre. The sharp attack on each note is characteristic of a string being plucked, and the articulation between notes suggests a fretted instrument. The register is in the mid-to-high range, which, combined with the plucked-string sound, strongly points to a guitar.
