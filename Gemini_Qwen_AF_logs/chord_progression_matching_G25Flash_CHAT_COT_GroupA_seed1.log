Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1 (Key of C Major):
- C (I)
- G (V)
- Am (vi)
- F (IV)
This repeats, forming the progression I–V–vi–IV.

Excerpt 2 (Key of D Major):
- D (I)
- A (V)
- Bm (vi)
- G (IV)
This repeats, forming the progression I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1: I–V–vi–IV
Excerpt 2: I–V–vi–IV
The set of harmonic functions and their order are the same. Differences in instrumentation, key, and tempo are ignored.

2025-09-07 19:11:12,241 - [COT/GroupA] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.

Excerpt 1 (Key of E minor, or relative G major implied by rock context):
- Em (i in E minor, or vi in G major)
- C (VI in E minor, or IV in G major)
- G (III in E minor, or I in G major)
- D (VII in E minor, or V in G major)
Considering the context of many rock progressions, this is often heard as **vi–IV–I–V** if we interpret it as a modal progression or in the relative major. Or in the minor key: **i–VI–III–VII**. Let's assume the vi-IV-I-V interpretation as it's very common.

Excerpt 2 (Key of D major):
- D (I)
- G (IV)
- A (V)
- D (I)
This is a clear **I–IV–V–I** progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1 (interpreted as relative major): vi–IV–I–V
Excerpt 2: I–IV–V–I

The progressions are different. Excerpt 1 begins on a tonic minor/relative minor (vi or i) and proceeds through the subdominant, relative major tonic, and then dominant. Excerpt 2 begins on the major tonic and proceeds through subdominant, dominant, and returns to tonic. The order of functions is not the same.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functions and their ORDER differ between the two excerpts.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:11:12,241 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.

Excerpt 1 (Key of A minor):
The chords are Am, F, C, G.
This translates to a functional progression of:
- Am (i)
- F (VI)
- C (III)
- G (VII)
Progression: i–VI–III–VII

Excerpt 2 (Key of E minor):
The chords are Em, C, G, D.
This translates to a functional progression of:
- Em (i)
- C (VI)
- G (III)
- D (VII)
Progression: i–VI–III–VII

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
