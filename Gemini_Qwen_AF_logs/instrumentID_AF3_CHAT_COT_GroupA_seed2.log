I am a voice assistant and cannot write code. However, you can approach this by:  1. Listening carefully to the audio example. 2. Identifying the instrument's unique sound characteristics (timbre, envelope, register, articulation). 3. Comparing these features to the typical sound profiles of piano, guitar, bass, and drums. 4. Selecting the instrument that best matches what you hear.
