2025-09-05 19:05:24,107 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: I am listening to a single melodic line played on a guitar. The melody starts on a low note and consistently moves upwards in pitch throughout the short phrase, ending on its highest note.
Step 2: The overall trend is a continuous rise in pitch from the beginning to the end. This fits the definition of an ascending contour.

C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:05:24,108 - Parsed Final Answer: C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)

Step 1: I am listening to a melodic line played on a piano. The melody starts on a high note, moves down in pitch to a low point around the middle of the excerpt, and then changes direction, moving back up in pitch to end on a high note.
Step 2: This global trend of falling and then rising fits the definition of an inverted arch.
