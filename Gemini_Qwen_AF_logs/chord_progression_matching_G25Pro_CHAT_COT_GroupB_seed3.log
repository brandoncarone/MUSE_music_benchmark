2025-09-07 17:06:57,129 - Stimuli: file1=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Intermediate/I-IV-V_Emaj_piano_150.wav, file2=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Intermediate/I-IV-V_Emaj_piano_120.wav
2025-09-07 17:07:10,402 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm (where chords change) and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key (e.g., I–vi–ii–V), ignoring inversions and extensions.
- Excerpt 1: The progression is Cmaj7 – G – Am – Fmaj7. In the key of C major, this is a I–V–vi–IV progression.
- Excerpt 2: The progression is Am – G – C – F. In the key of C major, this is a vi–V–I–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle:
- Progression 1: I–V–vi–IV
- Progression 2: vi–V–I–IV
While both progressions use the same four chords, the order in which they appear is different. For instance, in Excerpt 1, the V chord resolves to the vi chord. In Excerpt 2, the V chord resolves to the I chord.

Step 3: Decision rule:
- The order of harmonic functions is different. Therefore, they are not the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:07:10,402 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1 is a funk piece. The chords are C major, G major, A minor, and F major. In the key of C major, this corresponds to a I–V–vi–IV progression.
- Excerpt 2 is a heavy rock piece. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In the key of G major, this also corresponds to a I–V–vi–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both excerpts follow the functional progression I–V–vi–IV. The order of the harmonic functions is identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the functional order matches exactly, despite the vast differences in key, instrumentation, tempo, and style, the two excerpts contain the same underlying chord progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1 is a piano-led pop ballad. The chords are G major, D minor, C major, and F major. The progression feels like it is in the key of C major. In C major, this corresponds to a V–ii–I–IV progression.
- Excerpt 2 is a clean electric guitar-led pop/rock piece. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. The progression feels strongly rooted in the key of G major. In G major, this corresponds to a I–V–vi–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: V–ii–I–IV
- Progression 2: I–V–vi–IV
The two progressions use different harmonic functions (e.g., ii vs. V, vi vs. I) and arrange them in a different order.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Because both the harmonic functions and their order are different, the two excerpts do not share the same underlying chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1 is a piano-led pop ballad. The chords are G major, D minor, C major, and F major. This progression functions as V–ii–I–IV in the key of C major.
- Excerpt 2 is a fingerstyle acoustic guitar piece. The chords are A minor, D minor, G major, and C major. This progression functions as vi–ii–V–I in the key of C major.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: V–ii–I–IV
- Progression 2: vi–ii–V–I
The two progressions use different sets of harmonic functions (e.g., Excerpt 1 uses a IV chord while Excerpt 2 uses a vi chord) and present them in a completely different order.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Because the harmonic functions and their order are different, the two excerpts do not share the same underlying chord progression.
