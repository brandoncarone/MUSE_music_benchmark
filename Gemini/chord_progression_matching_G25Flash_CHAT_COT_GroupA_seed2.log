2025-09-07 19:14:48,185 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1 (0:00-0:04): The progression is E minor (vi), C major (IV), G major (I), D major (V). In the key of G major, this is vi-IV-I-V.
Excerpt 2 (0:00-0:04): The progression is B minor (vi), G major (IV), D major (I), A major (V). In the key of D major, this is vi-IV-I-V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
Both excerpts follow the functional progression vi-IV-I-V. They differ in key, instrumentation, and tempo, but the order of harmonic functions is identical.

Step 3: Decision.
The functional ORDER matches across one cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:14:48,185 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

2025-09-07 19:16:54,875 - [COT/GroupA] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The key is C major. The progression is C (I) - F (IV) - C (I) - G (V). So, I-IV-I-V.
Excerpt 2: The key is C major. The progression is C (I) - F (IV) - C (I) - G (V). So, I-IV-I-V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts follow the exact same functional order: I-IV-I-V. They are also in the same absolute key, but even if they were in different keys, the functional order would be the same. The differences in instrumentation, tempo, and playing style are to be ignored.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
