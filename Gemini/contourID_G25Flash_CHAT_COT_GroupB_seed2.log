2025-09-05 19:19:36,327 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melodic line clearly starts at a medium pitch, ascends to a higher peak, and then descends back down to a lower pitch by the end.
Step 2: This pattern of rising to a peak and then falling fits the definition of an Arch.
A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:19:36,328 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:19:36,328 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=C. Ascending (pitch raises over time))

Step 1: The melodic line starts at a higher pitch, descends to a low point, and then ascends again towards the end.
Step 2: This pattern of falling to a trough and then rising fits the definition of an Inverted Arch.

2025-09-05 19:19:38,567 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

2025-09-05 19:19:41,779 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melodic line starts at a lower pitch and progressively moves to higher pitches throughout its duration. There are no clear descents after an ascent, or ascents after a descent that would define an Arch or Inverted Arch. The overall motion is consistently upward.
Step 2: This global trend of pitches generally rising from start to end best fits the "Ascending" category.
C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:19:41,780 - Parsed Final Answer: C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:19:41,780 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending))

2025-09-05 19:19:45,200 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melodic line starts at a relatively higher pitch, clearly descends to a lower point (a trough), and then begins to ascend again from that low point.
Step 2: This pattern of first falling to a low point and then rising fits the definition of an Inverted Arch.
B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:19:45,200 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

2025-09-05 19:19:49,214 - [COT/GroupB] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melodic line clearly begins at a lower pitch and moves progressively higher, maintaining an upward trajectory throughout its duration.
Step 2: This consistent upward movement from start to end fits the definition of an Ascending contour.
C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:19:49,214 - Parsed Final Answer: C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:19:49,214 - Evaluation: Correct

Step 1: The melodic line starts at a higher pitch, descends significantly to a low point, and then rises from that low point.
Step 2: This pattern of first falling and then rising fits the definition of an Inverted Arch.
B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:19:53,253 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

2025-09-05 19:19:57,872 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The melodic line starts at a mid-range pitch, then quickly descends to a low point, and subsequently rises from that low point towards the end of the excerpt.
Step 2: This pattern of first falling to a trough and then rising again matches the definition of an Inverted Arch.
B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:19:57,872 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

Step 1: The melodic line starts at a higher pitch and systematically moves to lower pitches throughout its duration. There is a clear overall downward movement.
Step 2: This consistent downward movement from start to end best fits the "Descending" category.
D. Descending (pitch falls over time)
2025-09-05 19:20:02,536 - Parsed Final Answer: D. Descending (pitch falls over time)
