2025-09-05 19:11:08,866 - Stimulus: file=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Ebmin_Scale_Arch_Piano.wav
2025-09-05 19:11:16,343 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
The melody starts on a low note, ascends scale-wise to a clear peak, and then descends in a similar fashion back to the starting pitch area. This rise-and-fall pattern is a classic arch shape.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:11:16,343 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)

2025-09-05 19:11:42,966 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
The melody starts on a low pitch, rises in a stepwise fashion to a clear peak in the middle, and then descends back to the starting pitch. This overall pattern of ascending and then descending is a clear example of an arch contour.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:11:42,966 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
