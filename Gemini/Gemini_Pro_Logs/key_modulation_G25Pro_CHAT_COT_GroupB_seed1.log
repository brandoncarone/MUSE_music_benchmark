The excerpt begins and ends with the same four-chord progression that firmly establishes a single key. There are no chromatic alterations, secondary dominants, or cadences that suggest a shift to a new tonal center. The entire piece stays within one diatonic framework.

The excerpt features a simple, repeating four-chord progression. All of the chords used are diatonic to the home key established at the beginning. There are no chromatic harmonies, secondary dominants, or cadential gestures that would indicate a shift to a new tonal center. The music remains firmly in the same key from start to finish.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:57:22,990 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:57:37,725 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
The piece establishes a clear minor key at the outset. While the progression frequently resolves to a major tonic chord, this functions as a temporary coloration (mode mixture) rather than a true modulation. The music immediately returns to the minor key's harmony, and the overall tonal center never shifts. The change is one of mode, not key.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:57:37,725 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:57:37,725 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:57:50,198 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt establishes a clear minor key and repeats the same harmonic progression throughout. While there are some chromatic chords that temporarily point to other scale degrees (tonicizations), they quickly resolve back within the harmonic context of the original key. The overall tonal center remains stable and unchanged from beginning to end, with no sustained movement to a new key area.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:57:50,198 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:58:00,084 - [COT/GroupB] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt is based on a very common four-chord progression that repeats. All the chords are diatonic to the initial key. There are no chromatic alterations, secondary dominants, or cadential patterns that would signal a shift to a new tonal center. The music remains firmly established in its original key from beginning to end.

B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:58:15,400 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear major key, let's call it D major, with a standard I-vi-IV-V progression. This establishes D as the tonal center. Around the halfway point (0:14), the harmonic focus shifts. A new progression begins which strongly establishes G major as the new tonal center. The chord D major, which was the original tonic, now functions as the dominant (V) chord leading to the new tonic, G major. This new key is then confirmed with its own stable progression. This is a clear and sustained shift from one tonal center (D major) to another (G major).

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:58:15,400 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:58:15,400 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:58:29,410 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear tonal center, likely E minor, established by the opening riff (E-G-A-C-D power chords). Around 0:11, the harmonic progression and riff structure change significantly. A new repeating riff begins on an A power chord (A5), followed by C5, G5, and D5. This new section strongly establishes A minor as the new tonal center, with the chords functioning as i-III-VII-IV in the new key. This is not a brief tonicization but a sustained shift to a new, stable key area that continues for the rest of the excerpt.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:58:29,410 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:58:29,410 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:58:45,673 - [COT/GroupB] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt establishes a clear key center (E major) at the beginning, using a V-I-IV progression (B-E-A). The piece then moves through several distinct sections with different chord progressions. One section uses a D major chord, which is a chromatic (borrowed) bVII chord, but it functions to lead back to the tonic E major, not to establish a new key. Later sections use standard diatonic progressions like ii-V-I (F#m-B-E) and vi-ii-V-I (C#m-F#m-B-E), all of which strongly reinforce the original key of E major. Despite the sectional nature of the music, the tonal center remains consistently E major throughout.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:58:45,674 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:58:45,674 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:59:05,141 - [COT/GroupB] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins by establishing a clear major key, G major, with a I-IV-V-I progression (G-C-D-G). Around the 10-second mark, the harmony shifts. A new progression begins, centered on E minor (the relative minor of G major). The crucial moment is the introduction of a B major chord, which is not native to the key of G major. This B major chord functions as the dominant (V) of E minor, creating a strong V-i cadence that firmly establishes E minor as the new tonal center. This new key is then maintained for the remainder of the excerpt, constituting a clear modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:59:05,141 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:59:05,141 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:59:16,797 - [COT/GroupB] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins by firmly establishing the key of C major with a clear I-vi-ii-V progression. At approximately 0:14, the harmonic center shifts decisively. A new progression begins which establishes G major as the new tonic. The presence of the D major chord, which functions as the dominant (V) of G, confirms this modulation, as its leading tone (F#) is not part of the original key of C major. This new key of G is sustained for the remainder of the excerpt, marking a clear modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:59:16,797 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:59:16,797 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
