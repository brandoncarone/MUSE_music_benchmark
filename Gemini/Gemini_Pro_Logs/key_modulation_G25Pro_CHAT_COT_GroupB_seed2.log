2025-09-07 23:00:39,608 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins by establishing a clear tonal center with a repeating chord progression. The harmony cycles through this progression multiple times without any significant chromatic alteration or cadential motion that would suggest a new key. The piece remains firmly rooted in its original tonal center from beginning to end.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:00:39,608 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:01:50,872 - [COT/GroupB] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear tonal center, cycling through a diatonic chord progression. Around the halfway point (approximately 0:14), the harmonic progression changes course. It introduces chords that are not native to the original key, creating a strong pull towards a new tonal center. This culminates in a clear ii-V-I cadence, which firmly establishes a new key before the excerpt ends. This shift is not a brief tonicization but a definitive move to a new stable home base.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:01:50,872 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:01:50,872 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:03:14,888 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear major key, establishing a stable tonal center with a repeating diatonic progression. Approximately halfway through, the harmonic structure shifts. New chords are introduced, including a minor chord on the dominant and a subsequent dominant seventh chord, which create a strong pull towards a new key. This transition resolves decisively through a strong cadence into a new tonal center, which is then confirmed with subsequent chords. This is a clear and established shift, not a temporary tonicization.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:03:14,889 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:03:14,889 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 23:05:08,608 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt establishes a clear tonal center from the beginning with a repeating chord progression. Although the progression varies in its sequence throughout the piece, the harmony consistently uses chords that are diatonic to the original key. There are no chromatic alterations, new leading tones, or cadential patterns that would suggest a shift to a new tonal center. The entire excerpt remains firmly rooted in the initial key.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:05:08,608 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:05:08,608 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 23:07:10,248 - [COT/GroupB] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear major key, established by a strong, repeating chord progression. The entire piece consists of this same four-chord loop (I-IV-I-V), which firmly roots the music in its initial tonal center. There are no chromatic chords, new leading tones, or cadential patterns to suggest a move to a new key. The harmony is static and remains within the original key from start to finish.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:07:10,248 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:09:34,763 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt establishes a clear minor tonal center from the beginning. The chord progression uses chords that are all diatonic to this original key, including both the natural minor's subtonic (VII) and the harmonic minor's dominant (V). This is standard practice within a single minor key. The harmony consistently resolves back to and reinforces the initial tonal center. There is no cadential motion or sustained harmonic shift to establish a new key.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:09:34,763 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:09:34,763 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:12:20,302 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins by establishing a clear tonal center in a major key. This key is reinforced by a repeating harmonic progression. At approximately 0:14, the harmonic character of the piece changes. A new chord progression is introduced that strongly prepares and resolves to a new tonal center. This new key is then confirmed and maintained for the remainder of the excerpt, creating a clear and sustained shift from the original key. This is a definitive modulation, not a brief tonicization.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:12:20,302 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 23:15:11,910 - [COT/GroupB] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt consists of a single, repeating four-chord progression. All the chords used are diatonic to the initial key. The harmony never introduces chromaticism, new leading tones, or any cadential motion that would establish a new tonal center. The music remains firmly in its original key from start to finish.

2025-09-07 23:18:29,494 - [COT/GroupB] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins in a clear tonal center, likely C major, cycling through a common vi-V-I-IV progression (Am-G-C-F). Around the halfway point (0:10), the harmony changes significantly. A chromatic sequence begins, leading to a strong ii-V-I cadence (Gm-C7-F) that decisively establishes F major as a new tonal center. This move to the subdominant key is well-prepared and conclusive, representing a clear shift of the "home base" rather than a temporary tonicization.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:18:29,494 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:18:29,494 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 23:21:54,231 - [COT/GroupB] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
The excerpt begins with a high-energy riff that establishes a clear tonal center, likely in E minor (using power chords like E5, C5, G5, D5). This section is repeated, solidifying this key as the home base. At approximately 0:11, the musical material shifts decisively. The main riff is transposed down a perfect fourth, establishing a new tonal center of B minor. This new key is then confirmed and sustained with subsequent harmonic movement that functions clearly within B minor. The shift is not a brief passing harmony but a structural change to a new, stable key area for a significant portion of the excerpt.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:21:54,232 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:21:54,232 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
