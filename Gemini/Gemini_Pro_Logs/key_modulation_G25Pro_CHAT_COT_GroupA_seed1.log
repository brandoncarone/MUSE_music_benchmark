2025-09-07 22:31:08,687 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The initial tonal center is established by the opening blues/rock chord progression, which creates a clear home base in a minor key.

Step 2: The excerpt consists of a repeating chord progression. The entire piece loops the same harmonic pattern without introducing new chords or cadential figures that would suggest a move to a new key.

Step 3: The music remains firmly in the original key from start to finish. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:31:08,688 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:31:08,688 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear, diatonic chord progression that establishes a major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The entire piece consists of this same four-chord progression repeating. There are no chromatic alterations, secondary dominants, or cadences that suggest a shift to a new tonal center. The harmony remains squarely within the confines of the initial key.

Step 3: The music does not establish a new tonal center. It remains in the original key from beginning to end. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:31:19,152 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:31:34,258 - [COT/GroupA] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins by establishing a clear tonal center in a minor key, alternating between the tonic and dominant chords (i - V).

Step 2: The progression then moves briefly to the relative major area (VI - III) before immediately returning to the original minor key's tonic-dominant pattern. This movement to the relative major is a common harmonic device and does not establish a new, stable tonal center. It functions as a temporary departure that quickly resolves back to the original key.

Step 3: Since the music never establishes and maintains a new key, and the brief shift to the relative major is not sustained, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:31:34,258 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:31:34,258 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear, diatonic chord progression (I-ii-V-I or similar) that firmly establishes a major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The entire piece consists of this same four-chord progression repeating without any alteration. There are no chromatic chords, secondary dominants, or cadential figures that would suggest a move to a new key. The harmony remains squarely within the confines of the initial key.

Step 3: Since the music never leaves the original tonal center, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear, diatonic chord progression that establishes a single, stable tonal center.

Step 2: The entire piece consists of this same four-chord progression repeating without any alteration. The harmony remains squarely within the confines of the initial key. There are no chromatic chords, secondary dominants, or cadential figures that would suggest a move to a new key.

Step 3: Since the music never leaves the original tonal center and simply repeats the same harmonic loop, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:32:11,617 - [COT/GroupA] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a stable major key, established by a clear diatonic chord progression.

Step 2: The initial progression repeats, solidifying the original key. However, around the 0:16 mark, the harmonic character changes significantly. The music shifts to the relative minor key. This new section has its own stable progression that confirms the minor key as the new tonal center, and this new key is maintained until the end of the excerpt.

Step 3: Since the music establishes and sustains a new tonal center (the relative minor), a key modulation has occurred.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:11,617 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:11,617 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:32:26,750 - [COT/GroupA] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a bright, major key, likely E major, established by a progression that moves through chords diatonic to that key (E, A, C#m, B).

Step 2: The initial progression repeats, but around 0:24, the harmonic character changes dramatically. The music shifts to the parallel minor of the subdominant, A minor. A new progression (Am - G - C - F) is introduced, which establishes this new tonal area. This section clearly abandons the original key of E major and establishes A minor as the new, stable tonal center, which is sustained for the remainder of the excerpt.

Step 3: The sustained shift to a new and stable tonal center (from E major to A minor) constitutes a key modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:26,750 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:26,750 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:32:45,858 - [COT/GroupA] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a clear minor key, establishing this as the initial tonal center. The progression cycles through chords diatonic to this minor key.

Step 2: Around the halfway point (approximately 0:13), the harmony begins to shift. A new section starts around 0:22 that uses a different set of chords. This new section is firmly in a major key. The final chords create a strong cadence (ii-V-I) that confirms this new major key as the new tonal center. The piece effectively moves from a minor key to its parallel major.

Step 3: The music establishes a new, stable tonal center (the parallel major) and confirms it with a cadence. This sustained shift in key constitutes a modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:45,858 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:32:45,858 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:32:57,783 - [COT/GroupA] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear chord progression that establishes a major key as the tonal center. The chords used (I, IV, vi, V, etc.) are all diatonic to this initial key.

Step 2: As the excerpt progresses, the specific sequence of chords changes, but the harmony remains consistently within the same major key. There are no chromatic alterations, secondary dominants, or cadential figures that suggest a move to a new tonal center. The piece simply explores different chords available within the original key.

Step 3: The music never establishes a new tonal center; it remains firmly rooted in the original key from start to finish. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:32:57,784 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:32:57,784 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:33:11,695 - [COT/GroupA] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear chord progression (I-IV-ii-V) that firmly establishes a major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The excerpt contains two distinct sections with different chord progressions. The first section repeats its pattern. The second section, starting around 0:16, uses a different sequence of chords. However, all the chords used throughout both sections are diatonic to the original key. The harmonic language never leaves the established home key.

Step 3: Although the chord progression changes, the music never establishes or even strongly implies a new tonal center. It remains firmly rooted in the original key from start to finish. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:33:11,695 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
