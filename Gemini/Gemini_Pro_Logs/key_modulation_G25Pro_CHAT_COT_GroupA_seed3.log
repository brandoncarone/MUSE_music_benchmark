2025-09-07 22:36:41,617 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear I-IV-I progression, establishing a major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The subsequent chord progression moves through various chords that are all diatonic to the original key (e.g., vi, ii, V, IV, iii). The harmonic movement feels like a standard, functional progression within a single key, consistently pointing back to the original tonic. There is no new leading tone or cadential motion that establishes and sustains a new tonal center.

Step 3: The music remains firmly in the original key throughout the excerpt. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:36:41,617 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:36:41,617 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The piece establishes a clear tonal center with a repeating I-IV-V progression in a major key.

Step 2: This exact harmonic progression loops throughout the entire excerpt without any deviation. There are no chromatic alterations, secondary dominants, or cadences that would suggest a move to a new key. The harmony consistently reinforces the original tonic.

Step 3: The music remains firmly rooted in its original key from beginning to end. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:37:52,472 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:39:19,836 - [COT/GroupA] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins by establishing a clear minor key as its tonal center. The chord progression is characteristic of a minor mode.

Step 2: The harmonic progression repeats throughout the entire excerpt. The chords used are all diatonic to the initial minor key. There is no introduction of a new leading tone, nor is there any cadential motion that would establish a new key center. The harmony remains static within the original tonality.

Step 3: Since the music never leaves its original tonal center, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:39:19,836 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:41:11,403 - [COT/GroupA] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in a clear major key, with a progression that establishes a stable tonal center (E major).

Step 2: The initial section remains within this key. However, around the 0:24 mark, the harmonic landscape changes significantly. The progression shifts to a series of chords (C major, then G major, then D major) that are not native to the original key. This C-G-D progression strongly implies and establishes a new tonal center of G major (functioning as IV-I-V in the new key).

Step 3: This shift is not a brief tonicization; it creates a new, stable "home base" for several measures, confirmed by its own dominant chord (D major). This clear establishment of a new key center constitutes a modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:41:11,404 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:41:11,404 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 22:43:10,995 - [COT/GroupA] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear, repeating chord progression in a major key. The progression is I - V - vi - iii - IV - I - ii - V, which firmly establishes the initial tonal center.

Step 2: This exact diatonic chord progression loops for the entire duration of the excerpt. All of the chords are native to the original key. There are no accidentals, secondary dominants, or cadential gestures that would suggest a shift to a new tonal center.

Step 3: The music remains consistently within the harmonic world of the original key from beginning to end. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:43:10,995 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 22:45:26,687 - [COT/GroupA] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins by establishing a clear minor key as its tonal center. The chord progression firmly grounds the listener in this tonality.

Step 2: The first half of the excerpt remains within this minor key. However, around the 0:21 mark, there is a clear harmonic shift. The progression moves through a sequence of chords (Fm - Bb - Eb) that function as a strong ii-V-I cadence into a new key.

Step 3: This new key, the relative major of the original key, is established as the new stable tonal center and is sustained for the rest of the excerpt. This is a definitive modulation, not a brief tonicization.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:45:26,687 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 22:45:26,687 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear I-V-vi-IV progression in a major key, which firmly establishes the initial tonal center.

Step 2: This exact four-chord progression loops continuously throughout the entire excerpt. All chords used are diatonic to the original key. There is no harmonic deviation, no chromaticism, and no cadential motion that would suggest a shift to a new key.

Step 3: The music remains entirely within the harmonic framework of the initial key. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear I-V-vi-IV progression in a major key, establishing a stable tonal center.

Step 2: The entire piece utilizes chords that are diatonic to this initial key. While the chord progression becomes more varied in the second half, it continues to use the chords native to the original tonality (e.g., ii, V, I, IV). There is no introduction of a new leading tone or a sustained cadential pattern that would establish a new tonal center. The harmony consistently resolves back to or functions within the original key.

Step 3: Since the music remains within the harmonic framework of the initial key from beginning to end, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 22:50:41,298 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear I-V-vi-IV progression, establishing a stable major key as the tonal center.

Step 2: The excerpt continues with different chord progressions, such as IV-I-ii-V and vi-IV-I-V. However, all of these progressions are diatonic to the original key and consistently reinforce the initial tonal center. There are no chromatic chords or sustained cadential motions that would establish a new key.

Step 3: The harmonic content remains entirely within the original key's framework throughout the piece. Therefore, no modulation occurs.
