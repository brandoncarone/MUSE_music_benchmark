2025-09-07 20:37:07,733 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: I listened to the sustained chord and the subsequent arpeggiation of its notes. The overall quality sounds bright and consonant.
Step 2: The interval between the first and second notes of the arpeggio is a major third (4 semitones). This confirms the chord's quality as major.

Step 1: I listened to the sustained chord and the arpeggiated notes that followed. The initial impression of the chord is bright and full.
Step 2: Analyzing the arpeggio, the interval between the first note (the root) and the second note (the third) is a major third. This interval of 4 semitones is the defining quality of a major chord.
