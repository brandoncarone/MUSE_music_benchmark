Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is in the key of G major. The chords are Gmaj7, Dmaj7, Emin7, and Cmaj7. In Roman numerals, this translates to I - V - vi - IV.
- Excerpt 2 is also in the key of G major. The chords are G, D, Em, and C. In Roman numerals, this translates to I - V - vi - IV.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: I - V - vi - IV
- Excerpt 2: I - V - vi - IV
The order of the harmonic functions is identical.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The functional order matches perfectly. The differences in tempo, instrumentation (jazzy piano trio vs. rock band), and chord voicings (major 7ths vs. basic triads) do not change the underlying progression. Therefore, they are the same.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:27:43,408 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will abstract the chord progression into Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is a fast rock piece. The chords are A minor, G major, C major, and F major. Relative to the key of C major, this progression is vi – V – I – IV.
- Excerpt 2 is a slower acoustic piece. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. Relative to the key of G major, this progression is I – V – vi – IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: vi – V – I – IV
- Excerpt 2: I – V – vi – IV
While both progressions use the same set of four harmonic functions (I, V, vi, IV), the order in which they are presented is different. Excerpt 1 starts on the submediant (vi), whereas Excerpt 2 starts on the tonic (I).

Step 3: Apply the decision rule.
- The rule states that the ORDER of harmonic functions must be the same. Since the order is different, they are not the same progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:29:44,833 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is in the key of G major. The chords are E minor, C major, G major, and D major. In Roman numerals, this translates to vi – IV – I – V.
- Excerpt 2 is also in the key of G major. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In Roman numerals, this translates to I – V – vi – IV.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: vi – IV – I – V
- Excerpt 2: I – V – vi – IV
Both excerpts use the same four chords, which are common in pop music. However, the starting point and the order of the chords within the cycle are different.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The rule states that the ORDER of harmonic functions must be the same for the progressions to be considered identical. Since the order differs, they are not the same progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:32:06,673 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is a fingerstyle acoustic piece. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In the key of G major, this progression is I – V – vi – IV.
- Excerpt 2 is a more upbeat, strummed electric guitar piece. The chords are also G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In the key of G major, this is also the I – V – vi – IV progression.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: I – V – vi – IV
- Excerpt 2: I – V – vi – IV
The order of the harmonic functions is identical in both excerpts.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The functional order matches perfectly. The significant differences in tempo, instrumentation, and playing style (fingerstyle vs. strumming) are superficial and do not alter the core harmonic structure. Therefore, they are the same progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:34:51,013 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will abstract the chord progression into Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is a piano ballad. The chords are C minor, A-flat major, E-flat major, and B-flat major. Analyzed in the relative major key of E-flat major, this progression is vi – IV – I – V.
- Excerpt 2 is a funk-pop piece with guitar, bass, and drums. The chords are G minor, E-flat major, B-flat major, and F major. Analyzed in the key of B-flat major, this progression is vi – IV – I – V.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: vi – IV – I – V
- Excerpt 2: vi – IV – I – V
The sequence of harmonic functions is identical in both excerpts.

Step 3: Decision rule application.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 is a funk-pop piece. The chords are G minor, E-flat major, B-flat major, and F major. Relative to the key of B-flat major, this progression is vi – IV – I – V.
- Excerpt 2 is a rock/pop piece. The chords are C major, G major, A minor, and F major. Relative to the key of C major, this progression is I – V – vi – IV.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: vi – IV – I – V
- Excerpt 2: I – V – vi – IV
Although both progressions use the same four common harmonic functions (I, IV, V, vi), the order in which they are presented is different. Excerpt 1 starts on the submediant (vi), while Excerpt 2 starts on the tonic (I).

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The rule requires that the ORDER of the harmonic functions must be the same. Since the order is different, they are not the same progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 features strummed electric guitars. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In the key of G major, this progression is I – V – vi – IV.
- Excerpt 2 features a clean electric guitar melody over a rock rhythm section. The chords are C major, G major, A minor, and F major. In the key of C major, this progression is also I – V – vi – IV.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: I – V – vi – IV
- Excerpt 2: I – V – vi – IV
The order of the harmonic functions is identical in both excerpts.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The functional order matches perfectly. Although the excerpts are in different keys and have distinct styles, their underlying harmonic structure is the same.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:46:11,160 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 features acoustic and electric guitars. The chords are A minor, C major, G major, and D major. In the key of G major, this progression is ii – IV – I – V.
- Excerpt 2 features a full rock band arrangement. The chords are E minor, C major, G major, and D major. In the key of G major, this progression is vi – IV – I – V.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: ii – IV – I – V
- Excerpt 2: vi – IV – I – V
The progressions share the final three chords in the same order (IV – I – V), but they begin with different harmonic functions. Excerpt 1 starts on the supertonic (ii), while Excerpt 2 starts on the submediant (vi).

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- The rule states that if the functions or their order differ, the progressions are not the same. Since the first chord in the cycle has a different function (ii vs. vi), the progressions are fundamentally different.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 16:50:56,974 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, I will identify the chord progression in terms of Roman numerals relative to its key.
- Excerpt 1 features a rock band. The chords are G major, D major, E minor, and C major. In the key of G major, this progression is I – V – vi – IV.
- Excerpt 2 features acoustic and electric guitars. The chords are A minor, C major, G major, and D major. In the key of G major, this progression is ii – IV – I – V.

Step 2: I will compare the two progressions.
- Excerpt 1: I – V – vi – IV
- Excerpt 2: ii – IV – I – V
The two progressions use different sets of harmonic functions (Excerpt 1 uses I, V, vi, IV, while Excerpt 2 uses ii, IV, I, V) and present them in a completely different order.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
- Since both the functions used and their order are different, these are not the same chord progression.
