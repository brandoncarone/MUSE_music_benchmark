2025-09-05 19:08:53,229 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
The melody begins on a high pitch, descends to a low point roughly in the middle of the phrase, and then ascends again, ending on a high pitch. This overall shape of falling and then rising corresponds to an inverted arch.

B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:08:53,229 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

2025-09-05 19:09:05,433 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
The melody starts on a low note, rises steadily to a peak in the middle of the phrase, and then descends back down. This up-then-down motion creates a clear arch shape.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:09:05,433 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)

2025-09-05 19:09:29,960 - [COT/GroupB] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
The melody begins with a descent to a low point, which occurs very early in the phrase. From that trough, the pitch generally rises for the remainder of the excerpt, creating a long ascending motion. This overall shape of falling and then rising best fits the description of an inverted arch.

B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:09:29,960 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

The melody begins on a low note, ascends steadily to a high point in the middle of the phrase, and then descends in a similar fashion, ending near the starting pitch. This overall shape of rising and then falling is a clear arch.

A. Arch (ascending and then descending)
2025-09-05 19:09:37,540 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Arch (ascending and then descending)

The melody starts on a relatively high pitch, descends to a clear low point (a trough) in the middle of the phrase, and then ascends again toward the end. This overall motion of falling and then rising creates an inverted arch shape.

B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:09:42,773 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
