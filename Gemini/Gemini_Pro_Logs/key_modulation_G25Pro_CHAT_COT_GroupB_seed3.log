2025-09-07 23:23:27,587 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins firmly in a major key, established by a I-vi progression. Let's call this G major.

Step 2: The progression introduces a chromatic chord around the 5-second mark, an A major chord. This chord functions as a secondary dominant (V of V), strongly pulling towards the dominant chord, D major. However, the music does not establish D major as a new tonal center. Instead, the progression quickly moves back to chords that are diatonic to the original key of G major (like C major, the IV chord) and concludes with a clear ii-V-I cadence (Am-D7-G) that reaffirms G major as the home key.

Step 3: The use of the A major chord is a brief tonicization of the dominant. Since a new key is not established and the music returns to and cadences in the original key, a modulation has not occurred.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:23:27,587 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:23:27,587 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt opens with a strong I-V-vi-IV progression in a major key. The tonal center is clearly established from the beginning.

Step 2: The entire musical passage consists of a repetition of this same four-chord progression. All the chords used are diatonic to the original key. There are no chromatic chords, no new leading tones, and no cadential patterns suggesting a shift to a different tonal center.

Step 3: The music remains firmly rooted in its original key from start to finish. There is no evidence of a modulation.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:24:33,131 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear I-vi-IV-V chord progression in a major key, establishing a stable tonal center from the outset.

Step 2: This exact four-chord diatonic progression is repeated for the entire duration of the excerpt. All chords used are native to the original key. There are no chromatic chords, no new leading tones, and no harmonic motion that suggests a shift to a new key.

Step 3: The music remains solidly within its original tonal center. No new key is ever suggested, let alone established. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:25:56,417 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:27:31,300 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a riff-based progression firmly in a minor key, likely A minor. The harmony centers around the A power chord, establishing it as the tonal center.

Step 2: Around the 11-second mark, the harmonic progression and overall feel change dramatically. The new progression is based on chords like C, G, D, and F. This progression strongly implies a new tonal center of C major (the relative major of the original A minor). This new section has a distinct harmonic character and is sustained until the end of the excerpt, creating a new sense of "home".

Step 3: The music clearly establishes a new and stable tonal center (C major) that is different from the initial key (A minor). This is a classic example of a modulation to the relative major.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:27:31,300 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:27:31,300 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a four-chord progression, likely starting on the tonic minor, establishing a clear tonal center. Let's analyze it in A minor for simplicity (i-bVII-bIII-bVI).

Step 2: The entire musical passage consists of a single repetition of this exact same four-chord progression. All the chords used are diatonic to the initial key (or its relative major). There are no chromatic chords, no new leading tones, and no cadential patterns that would suggest a shift to a different tonal center.

Step 3: The harmonic foundation is static and loops without deviation. The key remains constant from the beginning to the end. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:29:15,415 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:29:15,415 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:31:35,134 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a repeating chord progression (Am-G-C-F), establishing a tonal center in the key of C major / A minor.

Step 2: The music cycles through variations of progressions based in C major for the first 30 seconds. However, at approximately 0:30, the entire harmonic progression shifts up by a half step to Bbm-Ab-Db-Gb. This introduces a completely new set of diatonic chords and establishes a new tonal center of Db major / Bb minor.

Step 3: This new key is not a brief tonicization; it is a full transposition of the main harmonic material and is sustained for the rest of the excerpt, creating a new and stable sense of "home." This clear and sustained shift constitutes a key modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:31:35,134 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:31:35,134 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-07 23:34:11,081 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a jazz-style chord progression that establishes a clear tonal center in a minor key, likely A minor. The progression uses chords like Am, Dm, G7, Cmaj7, Fmaj7, Bm7b5, and E7.

Step 2: The entire progression functions to reinforce the key of A minor. While it includes a brief tonicization of the relative major (C major) with the Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 sequence, it immediately moves on and concludes with a very strong ii-V-i cadence (Bm7b5 - E7 - Am) that firmly re-establishes A minor as the tonic. This entire harmonic cycle is then repeated.

Step 3: The music never establishes a new, stable tonal center. The brief movement towards C major is a temporary tonicization that quickly resolves back to the original key. The harmonic structure is designed to confirm, not leave, the home key. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:34:11,081 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:37:07,732 - [COT/GroupB] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a progression that firmly establishes the key of Eb major. The initial chords (Eb, Ab) set up a clear I-IV relationship. The progression then moves through a ii-V-i in the relative minor (Dm7b5-G7-Cm) before returning to the dominant (Bb7) and tonic (Eb), solidifying Eb major as the tonal center.

Step 2: The second half of the excerpt (starting around 0:15) introduces a new chord progression: Gm7 - C7 - Fmaj7 - Bb7. This is a classic iii-VI-ii-V progression in the key of Eb major. The C7 chord is a secondary dominant (V of ii), which strongly leads to the ii chord (Fm, here substituted with Fmaj7, a common jazz alteration). This entire sequence functions to lead back to the tonic, Eb.

Step 3: The harmonic motion, including the secondary dominant (C7), serves to embellish and strengthen the original key, not to leave it. The music never establishes a new, stable tonal center. The entire excerpt can be analyzed functionally within the single key of Eb major. Therefore, a modulation does not occur.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:37:07,732 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:37:07,732 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a I-V-vi-IV chord progression (likely C-G-Am-F), which is one of the most common progressions in popular music and very clearly establishes a major key tonal center.

Step 2: This exact four-chord diatonic progression is repeated for the entire duration of the excerpt. All the chords are native to the original key. There is no introduction of chromatic chords, new leading tones, or any harmonic movement that would suggest a shift to a new tonal center.

Step 3: The music remains firmly within the established key from start to finish. Since no new key is ever even hinted at, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-07 23:40:11,392 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-07 23:43:31,308 - [COT/GroupB] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear chord progression in the key of D major. The opening progression can be analyzed as I-IV-ii-V (Dmaj7 - Gmaj7 - Em7 - A7), which firmly establishes D as the tonal center.

Step 2: For the first half of the piece, the harmony remains within D major. However, at approximately 0:17, the harmonic progression shifts. We hear a clear ii-V-I cadence (Bm7 - E7 - Amaj7) that strongly resolves to A major. Following this cadence, the harmony continues to support A major as the new tonal center, with the Dmaj7 chord now functioning as the subdominant (IV) of the new key.

Step 3: The music clearly establishes a new and stable tonal center (A major), which is the dominant key of the original key (D major). This shift is prepared and confirmed with strong cadential motion and is sustained for the remainder of the excerpt. This is a textbook example of a modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-07 23:43:31,308 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
