Step 1: The pulse in both excerpts is clear and steady. The smallest repeating cycle in both cases is a one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This is a straight-feel rock beat, which can be interpreted in 4/4 time. The kick drum plays on beats 1 and 3, the snare drum plays on beats 2 and 4 (a standard backbeat), and the closed hi-hat plays continuous eighth notes.
- Excerpt 2: This excerpt presents the identical rhythmic structure. It has a straight feel in 4/4, with the kick on 1 and 3, the snare on 2 and 4, and continuous eighth notes on the hi-hat.

Step 3: A direct comparison reveals that the cycle lengths, rhythmic feel, meter, and the specific placement of kick, snare, and hi-hat hits are identical across both excerpts. No hits are added, removed, or shifted.

Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: The pulse is clearly defined in both excerpts. The repeating cycle in both cases is a two-bar phrase, characterized by a specific kick drum pattern and a tom fill at the end of the second bar.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This pattern has a straight, 16th-note feel, likely in 4/4 time. It features a syncopated kick drum pattern, a consistent snare backbeat on beats 2 and 4, steady hi-hats, and a tom-tom fill that concludes the two-bar phrase.
- Excerpt 2: This is an identical audio clip to the first one. It therefore has the same straight feel, 4/4 meter, and the exact same placement of kick, snare, hi-hat, and tom hits.

Step 3: Since the second excerpt is a literal repetition of the first, all rhythmic elements are identical. The cycle length, feel, meter, and the precise timing of every drum and cymbal hit match perfectly.

Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: Both excerpts establish a clear pulse and can be interpreted as repeating two-bar phrases.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This pattern has a straight, 16th-note subdivision feel, likely in 4/4. It features a syncopated kick drum pattern and a prominent tom fill at the end of the second bar. The snare maintains a consistent backbeat on beats 2 and 4.
- Excerpt 2: This pattern also has a straight feel in what sounds like 4/4. However, the kick drum pattern is simpler and less syncopated than in the first excerpt. The snare is also on beats 2 and 4. Crucially, there is no tom fill at the end of the two-bar phrase.

Step 3: While both patterns share a similar feel and meter, their core rhythmic structures are different. The kick drum patterns do not match, and Excerpt 1 includes a tom fill that is entirely absent from Excerpt 2. These differences mean the patterns are not the same.

No, these are not the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: The first excerpt establishes a simple, one-bar repeating cycle. The second excerpt presents a more complex pattern that repeats over a two-bar cycle, concluding with a tom fill.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This is a very standard, straight-feel rock beat. It features a kick on beats 1 and 3, a snare on 2 and 4, and continuous eighth notes on the hi-hat. The meter is a clear 4/4.
- Excerpt 2: This pattern also has a straight feel, but with more activity and syncopation, implying a 16th-note subdivision. The kick drum pattern is more complex than in the first excerpt. Most notably, it includes a tom fill at the end of its two-bar phrase.

Step 3: The two patterns differ in several fundamental ways. Their repeating cycle lengths are different (one bar vs. two bars). The kick drum patterns are not the same. The overall rhythmic complexity is different, and Excerpt 2 contains a tom fill which is completely absent in Excerpt 1.

No, these are not the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: The pulse is clear in both excerpts, and each one presents a repeating one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This is a straight-feel disco or funk beat, likely in 4/4 time. It features a "four-on-the-floor" kick drum pattern (playing on every quarter note: 1, 2, 3, 4), a snare on beats 2 and 4, and continuous eighth notes on the hi-hat.
- Excerpt 2: This is a standard, straight-feel rock beat, also in 4/4. The snare is on beats 2 and 4, and the hi-hat plays continuous eighth notes. However, the kick drum only plays on beats 1 and 3.

Step 3: While the cycle length, feel, and meter are the same, the core rhythmic structure is different due to the kick drum. Excerpt 1 has a kick drum on all four beats, whereas Excerpt 2 only has a kick drum on beats 1 and 3. This difference in the placement of hits for a primary drum voice makes the patterns fundamentally different.

No, these are not the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: Both excerpts have a clear pulse and a repeating cycle that is one bar long.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This is a fast, straight-feel funk or disco pattern in 4/4 time. It features a kick drum on every quarter note (four-on-the-floor), a snare on beats 2 and 4 with additional ghost notes, and a busy 16th-note pattern on the hi-hat.
- Excerpt 2: This is also a straight-feel disco pattern in 4/4 with a four-on-the-floor kick drum and a snare on beats 2 and 4. However, the hi-hat pattern is simpler, playing continuous eighth notes, and there are no extra ghost notes on the snare.

Step 3: While both patterns share the same basic kick and snare foundation, they are not identical. The hi-hat rhythm is different (16th notes in the first excerpt vs. 8th notes in the second), and the first excerpt contains additional snare embellishments (ghost notes) that are absent in the second. These differences make them distinct patterns.

No, these are not the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: A clear, slow pulse is established in both excerpts. The rhythmic phrase in both cases is a one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This pattern has a straight feel, which can be interpreted in 4/4 time. It features a syncopated kick drum pattern hitting on beat 1 and the "and" of 2. The snare drum hits on beat 3, creating a displaced backbeat feel. A crash cymbal is played on beat 1.
- Excerpt 2: This is an identical audio clip to the first one. It therefore has the exact same straight feel, meter, and placement of kick, snare, and cymbal hits.

Step 3: The comparison is straightforward as the two excerpts are identical recordings. Consequently, the cycle length, rhythmic feel, meter, and the specific onset positions for each drum voice are exactly the same.

Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: Both excerpts establish a clear, steady pulse. The smallest repeating cycle in both cases is a one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This is a classic "four-on-the-floor" disco/funk beat with a straight feel, which can be interpreted in 4/4 time. The kick drum plays on every quarter note (beats 1, 2, 3, and 4), the snare drum plays on the backbeats (2 and 4), and the hi-hat plays continuous eighth notes.
- Excerpt 2: This is the exact same audio clip as the first excerpt. Therefore, it has the same straight feel, 4/4 meter, and the identical placement of kick, snare, and hi-hat hits.

Step 3: Since the second excerpt is a literal repetition of the first, a comparison shows that the cycle length, rhythmic feel, meter, and the precise timing of every drum and cymbal hit are a perfect match.

Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.

Step 1: The first excerpt establishes a slow, sparse one-bar pattern. The second excerpt establishes a much denser, driving one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This has a straight feel, likely in a slow 4/4. It features a crash cymbal and kick on beat 1, another kick on the "and" of 2, and a single snare hit on beat 3. The overall feel is open and syncopated.
- Excerpt 2: This has a fast, straight, 16th-note feel, also likely in 4/4. It's a driving funk/disco beat with a "four-on-the-floor" kick drum (hitting on every beat), a snare on beats 2 and 4 with additional ghost notes, and a busy 16th-note hi-hat pattern.

Step 3: The two patterns are drastically different. The kick drum patterns do not match (syncopated vs. four-on-the-floor). The snare drum placements are different (beat 3 vs. beats 2 and 4). The cymbal work is different (single crash vs. continuous hi-hat). The overall rhythmic density and feel are completely dissimilar.

Step 1: Both excerpts establish a clear, driving pulse. The smallest repeating cycle in both cases is a one-bar pattern.

Step 2:
- Excerpt 1: This pattern has a straight, 16th-note subdivision feel, characteristic of funk or disco music, and can be interpreted in 4/4 time. It features a "four-on-the-floor" kick drum (hitting on every quarter note), a snare on the backbeats (2 and 4) embellished with syncopated ghost notes, and a continuous, busy 16th-note hi-hat pattern.
- Excerpt 2: This is an identical audio clip to the first one. As such, it possesses the exact same straight feel, meter, and precise placement for every kick, snare, and hi-hat hit.
