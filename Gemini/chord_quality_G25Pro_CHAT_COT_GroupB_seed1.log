--- Question 1 ---

2025-09-07 20:41:20,067 - Stimulus: file=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Dbminor_Piano_120.wav
2025-09-07 20:41:39,288 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: I listened to the sustained chord and the subsequent arpeggiation.
Step 2: The interval between the first note (the root) and the second distinct note in the arpeggio is a major third (an interval of 4 semitones). This interval gives the chord its characteristic major quality.

A. Major

Step 1: I have listened to the sustained chord and the arpeggiated notes.
Step 2: The interval between the first note (the root) and the second distinct note in the arpeggio is a minor third (an interval of 3 semitones). This gives the chord its characteristic minor quality.

2025-09-07 20:42:18,133 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: I have listened to the sustained chord and the arpeggiated notes that follow.
Step 2: By listening to the arpeggio, I can identify the interval between the root (the first note) and the third (the second distinct note). This interval is a minor third, spanning 3 semitones, which gives the chord a "sad" or "dark" quality.

B. Minor

Step 1: I have listened to the sustained chord and the arpeggiated notes.
Step 2: The interval between the root (the first note of the arpeggio) and the third (the second distinct note) is a major third, spanning 4 semitones. This gives the chord its characteristic bright, "happy" sound.
