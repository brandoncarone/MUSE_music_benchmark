2025-09-05 18:42:28,957 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both excerpts establish a clear pulse and form a one-bar repeating cycle.
Step 2:
Excerpt 1:
Feel: straight.
Meter: inferred 4/4.
Position analysis: Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hats on all eighth notes, with a crash on 1. No tom hits.
Excerpt 2:
Feel: straight.
Meter: inferred 4/4.
Position analysis: Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hats on all eighth notes, with a crash on 1. No tom hits.
Step 3: Cycle lengths, rhythmic feel, and meter match. The positions for Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat/Cymbal, and Toms are identical across both excerpts.
Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.
2025-09-05 18:42:28,957 - Parsed Final Answer: Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.
2025-09-05 18:42:28,957 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=No, these are not the same exact drum set patterns.)

Step 1: Both excerpts establish a clear pulse and form a one-bar repeating cycle.
Step 2:
Excerpt 1:
Feel: straight.
Meter: inferred 4/4.
Position analysis: Kick on beat 1. Snare on beats 2 and 4. Closed hi-hats play consistent eighth notes (1&2&3&4&). No tom hits.
Excerpt 2:
Feel: straight.
Meter: inferred 4/4.
Position analysis: Kick on beat 1. Snare on beats 2 and 4. Closed hi-hats play consistent eighth notes (1&2&3&4&). No tom hits.
Step 3: Cycle lengths, rhythmic feel, and meter match. The positions for Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat/Cymbal, and Toms are identical across both excerpts. No hits are added, removed, or moved, and no drum voices are swapped.

Yes, these are the same exact drum set patterns.
