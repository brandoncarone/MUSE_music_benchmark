Step 1: The two audio files have the same number of notes (8 notes).
Step 2:
For 'M6_Cm_120_Piano', the interval sequence (in semitones) is approximately: [+2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2] (ascending C natural minor scale)
For 'M7_CMaj_140_Piano', the interval sequence (in semitones) is approximately: [+2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1] (ascending C major scale)
Step 3: The interval sequences do not match element-by-element.

No, these are not the same melody.

2025-09-05 03:47:33,219 - [COT/GroupB] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1:
- 'M7_DbMaj_140_Piano' has 8 notes.
- 'M8_AbMaj_95_Piano' has a significantly larger number of notes, approximately 19-20 notes.

Step 2: Since the number of notes is different, computing and comparing the full interval sequences is not necessary to determine non-equivalence.

Step 3: The two melodies do not have the same number of notes. Therefore, they cannot be considered the same melody under transposition.

No, these are not the same melody.

2025-09-05 03:47:54,904 - Stimuli: file1=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/M5_Bm_100.wav, file2=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/M5_Dm_100.wav
2025-09-05 03:48:05,230 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the sequence of pitched notes (monophonic).
-   'M5_Bm_100' consists of a repeating melodic phrase, played twice. The sequence has 12 notes.
-   'M5_Dm_100' also consists of the same repeating melodic phrase, played twice. The sequence has 12 notes.
-   Both melodies have the same number of notes (12).

Step 2: Compute the interval sequence in semitones for each melody.
Let's denote the relative pitches based on the starting note for the first phrase and then account for the repeat.

For 'M5_Bm_100':
-   Starting on B. The sequence of notes for the first phrase is B, D, B, A, F#, B.
-   Intervals for the first phrase: [+3 (B to D), -3 (D to B), -2 (B to A), -3 (A to F#), +5 (F# to B)].
-   The melody repeats this phrase. The transition between the end of the first phrase (B) and the start of the second phrase (B) is a 0 interval.
-   The full interval sequence is: [+3, -3, -2, -3, +5, 0, +3, -3, -2, -3, +5].

For 'M5_Dm_100':
-   Starting on D. The sequence of notes for the first phrase is D, F, D, C, A, D.
-   Intervals for the first phrase: [+3 (D to F), -3 (F to D), -2 (D to C), -3 (C to A), +5 (A to D)].
-   The melody repeats this phrase. The transition between the end of the first phrase (D) and the start of the second phrase (D) is a 0 interval.
-   The full interval sequence is: [+3, -3, -2, -3, +5, 0, +3, -3, -2, -3, +5].

Step 3: Decide transposition equivalence.
-   Both melodies have the same number of notes (12).
-   Their computed interval sequences match element-by-element exactly:
    -   M5_Bm_100: [+3, -3, -2, -3, +5, 0, +3, -3, -2, -3, +5]
    -   M5_Dm_100: [+3, -3, -2, -3, +5, 0, +3, -3, -2, -3, +5]

Yes, these are the same melody.
