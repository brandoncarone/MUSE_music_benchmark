2025-09-05 03:42:12,214 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify note sequences.
Both audio files consist of a sequence of 36 notes.

Step 2: Compute the interval sequence in semitones.

For 'M9_Em_200_3_4_Piano':
(Starting with E4 for reference)
E4, E4, F#4, F#4, G4, G4, A4, A4, B4, B4, C5, C5, D5, D5, E5, E5, F#5, F#5, G5, G5, A5, A5, B5, B5, C6, C6, D6, D6, E6, E6, C6, C6, G5, G5, C6, C6, E6, E6, E6
Interval sequence: [0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, -4, 0, -7, 0, +5, 0, +4, 0]

For 'M9_Gm_200_3_4_Piano':
(Starting with G4 for reference)
G4, G4, A4, A4, Bb4, Bb4, C5, C5, D5, D5, Eb5, Eb5, F5, F5, G5, G5, A5, A5, Bb5, Bb5, C6, C6, D6, D6, Eb6, Eb6, F6, F6, G6, G6, Eb6, Eb6, Bb5, Bb5, Eb6, Eb6, G6, G6, G6
Interval sequence: [0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, -4, 0, -7, 0, +5, 0, +4, 0]

Step 3: Decide transposition equivalence.
Both melodies have the same number of notes (36).
Both melodies have identical interval sequences: [0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, +1, 0, +2, 0, +2, 0, -4, 0, -7, 0, +5, 0, +4, 0].

Since both conditions are met, the melodies are the same up to transposition.

Yes, these are the same melody.
2025-09-05 03:42:12,214 - Parsed Final Answer: Yes, these are the same melody.

2025-09-05 03:42:27,264 - [COT/GroupA] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the sequence of pitched notes (monophonic).
For both audio files, the sequence appears to have the same number of notes, which is 16.

Step 2: Compute the interval sequence in semitones for each melody.

For 'M10_Dbm_165_3_4':
Starting pitch (relative P0): P0
Intervals: -4, +4, +5, -7, +3, +3, -7, +3, +5, +3, +5, -7, -3, -5, -5
(This represents a sequence of 15 intervals for 16 notes.)

For 'M10_Fm_165_3_4':
Starting pitch (relative P0): P0
Intervals: -7, +7, +5, -7, +3, +3, -7, +3, +5, +3, +5, -7, -3, -5, -5
(This also represents a sequence of 15 intervals for 16 notes.)

Step 3: Decide transposition equivalence.
Both melodies have the same number of notes (16).
However, their interval sequences do not match element-by-element.
The first three intervals are different:
'M10_Dbm_165_3_4': [-4, +4, +5, ...]
'M10_Fm_165_3_4': [-7, +7, +5, ...]

Since the interval sequences are not identical, these are not the same melody under transposition.

No, these are not the same melody.
2025-09-05 03:42:27,265 - Parsed Final Answer: No, these are not the same melody.
2025-09-05 03:42:27,265 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=Yes, these are the same melody.)

2025-09-05 03:42:34,516 - [COT/GroupA] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the sequence of pitched notes (monophonic).
For 'M10_Fm_165_3_4': This melody consists of 16 notes.
For 'M6_Bbm_120_Piano': This melody consists of 15 notes.

Step 2: Compute the interval sequence in semitones for each melody.
For 'M10_Fm_165_3_4': (15 intervals)
[-7, +7, +5, -7, +3, +3, -7, +3, +5, +3, +5, -7, -3, -5, -5]

For 'M6_Bbm_120_Piano': (14 intervals)
[-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, +2, +2, +2, +2, +2, +2, +2]

Step 3: Decide transposition equivalence.
The two melodies do not have the same number of notes (16 vs 15).
Consequently, their interval sequences also have different lengths (15 vs 14) and thus cannot match element-by-element.

Therefore, these are not the same melody under transposition.

No, these are not the same melody.
2025-09-05 03:42:34,516 - Parsed Final Answer: No, these are not the same melody.

[-4, +4, +5, -7, +3, +3, -7, +3, +5, +3, +5, -7, -3, -5, -5]

Step 3: Decide transposition equivalence.
The two melodies do not have the same number of notes (36 vs 16).
Consequently, their interval sequences also have different lengths (35 vs 15) and thus cannot match element-by-element.

Therefore, these are not the same melody under transposition.
