Step 1: The piece begins in G major, establishing this as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces G major. There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor are there sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a new stable tonal center. The chords used are diatonic to G major.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of G major for the entire duration. No modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:30:07,800 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins in C major, which is established as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the piece, the harmonic progression consistently returns to and emphasizes C major. There are no cadences into a new key, nor are there any sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a different stable tonal center. All chords function diatonic to C major.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of C major without any sustained shift to a new tonal center. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:31:03,963 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt begins in F major, establishing this as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Around the 0:16 mark, the harmonic progression begins to shift. A new leading tone (G#) is introduced, suggesting a move to A major or A minor. By 0:20, a clear V-I cadence into A major firmly establishes this new tonal center. This new key is then sustained until the end of the excerpt.
Step 3: The music establishes and maintains a new tonal center (A major) through cadential motion and the introduction of a new leading tone. Thus, a modulation occurs.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:32:14,764 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:32:14,764 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-08 00:33:51,981 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear C major chord and subsequent harmonies firmly establish C major as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the entire excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces C major. All chords (e.g., C, F, G, Am) are diatonic to C major, and the cadential movements repeatedly lead back to C major, solidifying it as the primary tonal center. There are no instances of new leading tones being introduced or sustained cadences into a different key.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of C major without any sustained shift to a new tonal center. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:33:51,981 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:33:51,981 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt begins in G major, establishing this as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the entire excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces G major. The chords used (G, C, D, Em) are all diatonic to G major, and the melodies and bass lines continue to support this tonal center. There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor are there sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a different stable tonal center.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of G major without any sustained shift to a new tonal center. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

2025-09-08 00:38:39,905 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with chords and melody that clearly establish E minor as the initial tonal center (Em - C - G - D progression, typical of E minor).

Step 2: From approximately 0:00 to 0:12, the music consistently remains in E minor. Around 0:13, there are some harmonic changes (e.g., D major, G major, C major, F# diminished, B major). However, this sequence of chords functions as a re-harmonization or a build-up leading directly to a strong dominant chord (B major at 0:17) which then resolves back to the tonic E minor at 0:18. While there is harmonic movement, no new key is established with a sustained cadence and a new stable leading tone that lasts for an extended period. The progression quickly leads back to the original E minor.

Step 3: The music does not establish and maintain a new tonal center. The harmonic variations are temporary and ultimately reinforce the original E minor. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:38:39,905 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:38:39,905 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-08 00:41:26,474 - [COT/GroupB] Q7 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in G major, with a clear G major chord and subsequent diatonic harmonies (G, C, D), establishing G major as the initial tonal center.

Step 2: Around the 0:17 mark, the harmonic progression shifts. A C minor chord appears, followed by a series of chords that establish a new tonal center. We then hear F major (0:21), Bb major (0:22), Eb major (0:23), F major (0:24), and Bb major again (0:25). This progression (F - Bb - Eb - F - Bb) clearly outlines a V-I, IV-V-I cadence in Bb major, effectively establishing Bb major as a new, sustained tonal center. This new key is maintained through the end of the excerpt.

Step 3: The music establishes and maintains a new tonal center (Bb major) with clear cadential motion and supporting harmonies for a significant duration in the latter half of the excerpt. This is a clear modulation, not merely a brief tonicization.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:41:26,474 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:41:26,474 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with harmonies (G major, C major, D major) that clearly establish G major as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the entire excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces G major. The chords used are all diatonic to G major (I, IV, V), and the melodic lines and bass continue to support this tonal center. There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor are there any sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a different stable tonal center.

2025-09-08 00:47:30,817 - [COT/GroupB] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with a C major 7th chord, but the subsequent harmonies (F# diminished, G major) immediately imply a strong pull towards G major. The repeated pattern (Cmaj7, F#dim, G) strongly suggests that G major is the primary tonal center, with C major functioning as the subdominant (IV) and F#dim as the leading-tone diminished chord (vii°). So, the initial tonal center is G major.

Step 2: Throughout the entire excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces G major. The chords used (C major, G major, D major, A minor, F# diminished) are all diatonic to G major (IV, I, V, vi, vii°). There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor are there sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a different stable tonal center. The harmonies consistently return to or function within the context of G major.

Step 3: The music remains in the original key of G major without any sustained shift to a new tonal center. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:47:30,817 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:47:30,817 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with a clear A minor chord progression (Am, G, F, E), establishing A minor as the initial tonal center. The E major chord functions as the dominant (V) of A minor.
Step 2: Throughout the entire excerpt, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces A minor. The recurring Am - G - F - E progression is diatonic to A minor (i - VII - VI - V) and strongly pulls back to the tonic A minor. There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor are there any sustained sections that establish a new leading tone or a different stable tonal center.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of A minor without any sustained shift to a new tonal center. Therefore, no modulation occurs.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:50:50,949 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
