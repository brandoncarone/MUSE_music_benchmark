2025-09-07 20:39:55,830 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The progression is clearly in a minor key. The chords are C minor, Ab major, Eb major, Bb major. In Roman numerals relative to C minor, this is i – VI – III – VII.

Excerpt 2: The progression is also in a minor key. The chords are E minor, C major, G major, D major. In Roman numerals relative to E minor, this is i – VI – III – VII.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1: i – VI – III – VII
Excerpt 2: i – VI – III – VII
The set of harmonic functions and their order are identical (i-VI-III-VII). The keys are different, as is the instrumentation and tempo, but these factors are to be ignored.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional order matches across the cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 20:39:55,830 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key.

Excerpt 1:
The key appears to be D major.
The chords are D major, G major, D major, A major.
In Roman numerals, this is: I – IV – I – V.

Excerpt 2:
The key appears to be E minor.
The chords are E minor, C major, G major, D major.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1: I – IV – I – V

The two progressions contain different sets of harmonic functions and follow a different order. Excerpt 1 is a common major key progression (tonic, subdominant, tonic, dominant), while Excerpt 2 is a common minor key progression (tonic, submediant, mediant, subtonic).
