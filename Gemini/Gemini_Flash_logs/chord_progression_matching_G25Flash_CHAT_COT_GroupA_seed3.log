2025-09-07 19:50:42,564 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The progression is I - IV - I - V (in C major). This pattern repeats.
Excerpt 2: The progression is I - IV - V (in C major). This pattern repeats, typically resolving to I to restart the cycle.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1: I - IV - I - V
Excerpt 2: I - IV - V

Step 3: The functional order and the number of chords within a single cycle differ. Excerpt 1 has a repeated 'I' chord before the dominant, while Excerpt 2 proceeds directly from IV to V.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:50:42,564 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:50:42,564 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=A. Yes, these are the same chord progression., prog1=I-VI-VI-V, prog2=I-VI-VI-V)

2025-09-07 19:50:50,845 - [COT/GroupA] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1 (Rock): The key appears to be A minor. The progression is A minor (i), G major (VII), D minor (iv), E major (V).
Thus, the progression is: **i - VII - iv - V**.

Excerpt 2 (Acoustic): The key appears to be E major. The progression is E major (I), A major (IV), E major (I), B major (V).
Thus, the progression is: **I - IV - I - V**.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
Excerpt 1: i - VII - iv - V
Excerpt 2: I - IV - I - V

Step 3: The harmonic functions and their order differ significantly. For example, the second chord in Excerpt 1 is a VII chord, while in Excerpt 2 it is a IV chord. The third chord also differs (iv vs I). Therefore, they are not the same progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:50:50,845 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Thus, the progression is: **I - IV - I - V**.

Excerpt 2: The key appears to be C major. The progression is C major (I), F major (IV), C major (I), G major (V). This pattern repeats.
Thus, the progression is: **I - IV - I - V**.

Excerpt 1: I - IV - I - V
