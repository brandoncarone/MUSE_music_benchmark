Step 1: Segment and abstract each to functional ORDER.
Excerpt 1: The first excerpt follows a I-IV-V-I chord progression (in C major).
Excerpt 2: The second excerpt also follows a I-IV-V-I chord progression (in C major).
Step 2: Both sequences contain the same set of harmonic functions in the same order (I-IV-V-I). They differ in instrumentation, tempo, and playing style, but the core progression is identical.
Step 3: The functional ORDER matches across the cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:56:12,446 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The progression is clearly C major (I), F major (IV), G major (V), C major (I). This is a I-IV-V-I progression.
Excerpt 2: The progression is also C major (I), F major (IV), G major (V), C major (I). This is a I-IV-V-I progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
Both excerpts follow the exact same sequence of harmonic functions: I-IV-V-I. The instrumentation, tempo, and specific voicings are different, but these are to be ignored as per the instructions.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across both cycles.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The key is C major. The progression is C major (I) -> F major (IV) -> G major (V) -> C major (I). This is a I-IV-V-I progression.
Excerpt 2: The key is C major. The progression is C major (I) -> F major (IV) -> G major (V) -> C major (I). This is also a I-IV-V-I progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts share the exact same sequence of harmonic functions: I-IV-V-I. They differ in instrumentation, tempo, and style, but these differences are to be ignored. The core harmonic progression is identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle for both excerpts.

2025-09-07 20:04:22,929 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key.
Excerpt 1: The progression clearly sounds like it starts on a minor chord, then moves to its relative major's subdominant, then to the relative major's tonic, and finally to the dominant.
In the key of G major:
- Em (vi)
- C (IV)
- G (I)
- D (V)
So, the progression is vi–IV–I–V.

Excerpt 2: This excerpt also starts on a minor chord and follows a similar harmonic motion.
In the key of C major:
- Am (vi)
- F (IV)
- C (I)
- G (V)
So, the progression is vi–IV–I–V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both Excerpt 1 and Excerpt 2 share the same functional chord progression: vi–IV–I–V. The keys are different (G major for Excerpt 1, C major for Excerpt 2), and the instrumentation, tempo, and style are different, but these factors are to be ignored according to the instructions. The order and type of harmonic functions are identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle for both excerpts.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 20:04:22,929 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

2025-09-07 20:08:00,157 - [COT/GroupB] Q5 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The key is A minor. The primary repeating pattern of the progression is:
A minor (i) -> G major (bVII) -> C major (bIII) -> F major (bVI) -> C major (bIII) -> G major (bVII) -> C major (bIII).
This is a sequence involving the minor tonic, subtonic, relative major, and submediant in the minor key.

Excerpt 2: The key is E major. The progression is:
E major (I) -> B major (V) -> C# minor (vi) -> A major (IV).
This is a very common I-V-vi-IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Excerpt 1's progression (i - bVII - bIII - bVI - bIII - bVII - bIII) is distinct from Excerpt 2's progression (I - V - vi - IV). The specific harmonic functions are different, and their order within the repeating cycles is also different.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER and the set of functions themselves differ between the two excerpts. Therefore, they are not the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 20:08:00,158 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The key appears to be G major. The progression is G major (I) -> E minor (vi) -> C major (IV) -> D major (V). This gives us a I-vi-IV-V progression.
Excerpt 2: The key also appears to be G major. The progression is G major (I) -> E minor (vi) -> C major (IV) -> D major (V). This also gives us a I-vi-IV-V progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts clearly follow the same sequence of harmonic functions: I-vi-IV-V. The instrumentation, tempo, and specific voicings are different, but these are to be ignored as per the instructions.

2025-09-07 20:32:33,446 - [COT/GroupB] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.

Excerpt 1:
The key is A minor.
The progression is:
*   A minor (i)
*   G major (bVII)
*   C major (bIII)
*   F major (bVI)
*   C major (bIII)
*   G major (bVII)
*   C major (bIII)
The primary repeating pattern is i - bVII - bIII - bVI (with some repetitions of bVII and bIII).

Excerpt 2:
The key is C major.
The progression is:
*   C major (I)
*   F major (IV)
*   G major (V)
*   C major (I)
The repeating pattern is I - IV - V - I.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
