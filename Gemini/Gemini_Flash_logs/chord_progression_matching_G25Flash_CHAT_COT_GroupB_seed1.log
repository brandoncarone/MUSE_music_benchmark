2025-09-07 19:52:21,418 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The progression is I - vi - ii - V, repeated. (e.g., in C major: C - Am - Dm - G)
Excerpt 2: The progression is I - vi - ii - V, repeated. (e.g., in C major: C - Am - Dm - G)

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts follow the exact same functional order: I - vi - ii - V. The instrumentation, tempo, and playing style are different, but these are to be ignored according to the instructions.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:52:21,418 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

2025-09-07 19:52:28,871 - [COT/GroupB] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key.
Excerpt 1: The progression is I - vi - IV - V, repeated. (e.g., in C major: C - Am - F - G)
Excerpt 2: The progression is vi - IV - I - V, repeated. (e.g., in C major: Am - F - C - G)

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
The functional order of the two excerpts is different. Excerpt 1 starts on the tonic (I), while Excerpt 2 starts on the submediant (vi). Although they use the same set of chords (I, IV, V, vi), their order is distinct.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER does not match across the cycle.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:52:28,871 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
Excerpt 1: The progression clearly sounds like a I-vi-IV-V progression. For example, in C major, this would be C-Am-F-G. This cycle repeats throughout the excerpt.
Excerpt 2: The progression also clearly sounds like a I-vi-IV-V progression. For example, in C major, this would be C-Am-F-G. This cycle repeats throughout the excerpt.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts follow the exact same functional order: I - vi - IV - V. The instrumentation, tempo, and playing style are different, but the core harmonic progression remains identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 19:52:34,783 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key.
Excerpt 1: The progression is clearly a I - vi - IV - V. For example, if we consider it in A major, the chords are A - F#m - D - E. This sequence repeats.
Excerpt 2: The progression is also clearly a I - vi - IV - V. For example, if we consider it in E major, the chords are E - C#m - A - B. This sequence repeats.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
Both excerpts follow the exact same functional order: I - vi - IV - V. The absolute keys are different (A major in Excerpt 1 vs E major in Excerpt 2), and the instrumentation, tempo, and playing style are distinct, but the harmonic functions and their order are identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
The functional ORDER matches across the cycle (I - vi - IV - V).

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key.
Excerpt 1: The progression clearly follows a I - IV - vi - V pattern. For instance, if in G major, the chords would be G - C - Em - D.
Excerpt 2: The progression clearly follows a I - V - vi - IV pattern. For instance, if in C major, the chords would be C - G - Am - F.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
The functional order of the two excerpts is different. Excerpt 1 has the order I - IV - vi - V, whereas Excerpt 2 has the order I - V - vi - IV. Even though they use the same set of diatonic functions (I, IV, V, vi), their sequence is not identical.
