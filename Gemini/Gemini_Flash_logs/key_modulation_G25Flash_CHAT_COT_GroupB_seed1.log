2025-09-08 00:10:40,260 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt opens with a clear C major tonality.
Step 2: The music briefly touches upon harmonies that might suggest a move towards the dominant (G major), such as a D major chord leading to G. However, these moments are short-lived and quickly return to firmly establish C major again. There is no sustained new tonal center with clear cadential activity solidifying a new key.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of C major. The brief harmonic shifts are more akin to tonicizations or secondary dominants that reinforce the original key, rather than establishing a new one.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:10:40,260 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:10:40,260 - Expected Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-08 00:11:31,088 - [COT/GroupB] Q2 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins in C minor, characterized by the minor quality of the opening chords.
Step 2: Around 0:05-0:06, there is a clear shift. A dominant chord (B-flat major) leads convincingly to an E-flat major chord. This establishes E-flat major as a new stable tonal center, which is the relative major of C minor. The music continues to support this new key until the end of the excerpt.
Step 3: A new tonal center (E-flat major) is clearly established and maintained.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:11:31,088 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.

2025-09-08 00:12:32,739 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins clearly in C major, establishing C as the tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the excerpt, the harmonic progression, including chords like C, F, G, and Am, consistently reinforces C major. There are no clear cadences into a new key, nor is there a sustained shift to a new leading tone that would establish a different tonal center. All harmonies appear to function within the C major key.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of C major. No new tonal center is established and maintained.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:12:32,739 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

2025-09-08 00:13:53,621 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The excerpt begins with chords that firmly establish C major as the initial tonal center (Am - Dm - G - C).
Step 2: Throughout the piece, the harmonic progressions consistently reinforce C major. Although there might be passing chords or brief embellishments, no sustained shift to a new tonal center occurs. There is no clear cadential motion that establishes a new key with a new leading tone. The harmonies remain within the diatonic or closely related secondary dominant context of C major.
Step 3: The music remains in the original key of C major from beginning to end.

B. No, the key stays the same.
2025-09-08 00:13:53,622 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, the key stays the same.

Step 1: The excerpt opens with a riff and chords that clearly establish E minor as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Throughout the piece, the harmonic progression consistently reinforces E minor. Chords used (like Am, D, G, C) are all diatonic to E minor or commonly used within the key to create tension and release back to the tonic.

Step 1: The excerpt begins with harmonies that firmly establish G major as the initial tonal center.
Step 2: Around 0:06-0:08, the music transitions to a new set of harmonies that strongly establish C major. A clear cadential motion (G major -> C major) followed by further progressions (C major, F major, G major) firmly supports C major as the new tonal center. This new key is maintained for the remainder of the excerpt.
Step 3: A new tonal center (C major) is clearly established and maintained after shifting from the initial key of G major.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:25:32,716 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
