2025-09-05 20:57:20,605 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both audio excerpts present a monophonic melody on a plucked string instrument (likely bass guitar).
Step 2: Upon listening and comparing, the sequence of pitches in Audio 1 is identical to the sequence of pitches in Audio 2. Each note at each corresponding position matches exactly in pitch.
Step 3: There are no differing pitches, out-of-key substitutions, or altered notes. No oddball is present.

Yes, these are the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:57:20,605 - Parsed Final Answer: Yes, these are the same exact melody.

2025-09-05 20:57:32,208 - [COT/GroupB] Q3 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both audio excerpts present a monophonic melody played on a piano.
Step 2: Aligning the two sequences and comparing pitches:
- The first five notes of Audio 1 and Audio 2 match exactly.
- The 6th note in Audio 1 is an A3, while the 6th note in Audio 2 is a G3. This is a different pitch.
- The 7th note in Audio 1 is an F#3, while the 7th note in Audio 2 is an E3. This is a different pitch.
- The 8th note in Audio 1 is a D4, while the 8th note in Audio 2 is a C4. This is a different pitch.
Step 3: Since multiple pitches differ between the two melodies, an oddball is present.

No, these are not the same exact melody.

2025-09-05 20:57:41,250 - [COT/GroupB] Q4 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both audio excerpts feature a monophonic melody played on a plucked string instrument (e.g., bass guitar).

Step 2: I will compare the note sequences pitch by pitch:
- The first four notes of both melodies (G3, C4, C4, D4) are identical.
- At the fifth note:
    - In Audio 1, the fifth note after D4 is a Bb3.
    - In Audio 2, the fifth note after D4 is an A3. This is a different pitch.
- At the sixth note:
    - In Audio 1, the sixth note after Bb3 is a G3.
    - In Audio 2, the sixth note after A3 is an F3. This is a different pitch.
- The subsequent notes (C4, C4, G3) appear to match again relative to their respective preceding notes, but the overall pitch sequence has diverged due to the previous changes.

Step 3: Since the pitches at the fifth and sixth positions clearly differ between the two excerpts, an oddball is present.

No, these are not the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:57:41,250 - Parsed Final Answer: No, these are not the same exact melody.

2025-09-05 20:57:55,859 - [COT/GroupB] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both audio excerpts feature a monophonic melody played on a plucked string instrument.

Step 2: Upon detailed comparison of the note sequences:
- The first six notes of Audio 1 and Audio 2 sound identical in pitch and melodic contour.
- The final, sustained note differs in pitch:
    - In Audio 1, the final note is a higher pitch.
    - In Audio 2, the final note is a lower pitch than its counterpart in Audio 1.

Step 3: Since the final note's pitch differs between the two melodies, an oddball is present.

No, these are not the same exact melody.

2025-09-05 20:58:12,879 - [COT/GroupB] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Both audio excerpts feature a monophonic melody played on a plucked string instrument (e.g., bass guitar).

Step 2: I will compare the note sequences pitch by pitch:
- Both melodies start with an open E note.
- The first five notes of both melodies (E, A, D, G, B) are identical.
- At the sixth note:
    - In Audio 1, the sixth note is an E (an octave higher than the starting E, likely E4).
    - In Audio 2, the sixth note is a D (likely D4). This is a different pitch from Audio 1 at the same position.
- The subsequent notes (C, G, E) then follow, but the specific pitch sequence has already diverged.

Step 3: Since the pitch at the sixth position differs between the two excerpts (E in Audio 1 vs. D in Audio 2), an oddball is present.

No, these are not the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:58:12,879 - Parsed Final Answer: No, these are not the same exact melody.
