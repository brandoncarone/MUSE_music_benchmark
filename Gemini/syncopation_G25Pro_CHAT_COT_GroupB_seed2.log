Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in a common 4/4 time with a clear, steady pulse established by the hi-hats playing eighth notes. The main kick and snare pattern in both excerpts repeats every two measures.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beats 1 and 3. The snare drum hits on the "and" of beat 2 and squarely on beat 4. The snare on the "and" of 2 is a syncopated, off-beat hit, but the snare on beat 4 provides a solid, on-beat anchor.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum lands on beats 1 and 3. The snare drum hits consistently on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4. Crucially, the strong backbeats (2 and 4) are entirely omitted and replaced by these off-beat snare hits.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 1 has one primary syncopated hit per measure (the snare on the 'and' of 2). Excerpt 2, however, displaces *both* backbeats to the following off-beat. By omitting the expected hits on beats 2 and 4 and placing them on the "and" of 2 and the "and" of 4, Excerpt 2 creates a much higher degree of rhythmic tension and off-beat emphasis.

B. The rhythm in Excerpt 2 is more syncopated.

Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in a 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat providing the pulse. The core kick and snare pattern in both excerpts repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and beat 3. A snare drum hits on the "and" of beat 1, immediately following the kick. Another snare drum provides a solid anchor on beat 4. The primary syncopation is the snare hit on the "and" of 1.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum also lands on beat 1 and beat 3. However, the snare drum hits occur on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4. This means the strong backbeats (beats 2 and 4) are entirely omitted and are instead replaced by off-beat accents.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 1 has one clear syncopated hit (the snare on the "and" of 1) but maintains a strong, on-beat backbeat on beat 4. Excerpt 2 is more syncopated because it systematically avoids *both* strong backbeats, displacing them to the subsequent off-beat. This consistent omission of expected accents in favor of unexpected ones creates a greater sense of rhythmic tension and syncopation.

B. The rhythm in Excerpt 2 is more syncopated.

Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in a standard 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The main kick/snare pattern in each repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum consistently lands on the "and" of beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum hits on beat 2 and beat 4. The most significant feature is the complete omission of the kick drum on the strong downbeats of 1 and 3. Instead, kicks are placed entirely on off-beats.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. This pattern establishes a very strong, grounded feel with the kick on beat 1 and snares on the backbeats. The only syncopation is the kick on the "and" of 2.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 2 is a very standard and stable rock beat with only one off-beat kick. Excerpt 1 is far more syncopated because it completely avoids placing the kick drum on the strong beats (1 and 3), instead placing both primary kick hits on off-beats. This consistent omission of strong-beat accents in favor of off-beat ones creates a much greater sense of rhythmic displacement and tension.

Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in 4/4 time with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The core kick and snare pattern in both repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and beat 3. A snare drum hits on the "and" of beat 1, and another snare hits on beat 4. The main syncopation is the snare on the "and" of 1, but the pattern is anchored by the kick on 1 & 3 and the snare on 4.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum hits on beat 1, the "and" of beat 2, and the "and" of beat 3. The snare drum hits only on beat 3. This pattern is highly unusual. The traditional backbeat on 2 and 4 is completely absent. Instead, the snare lands on the strong beat 3, and the kick drum provides a lot of off-beat propulsion.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 1 contains a single, common syncopated figure but is otherwise very grounded in the beat. Excerpt 2 is significantly more syncopated. It completely abandons the standard backbeat structure (snare on 2 and 4), displaces the main snare accent to beat 3, and fills the measure with multiple off-beat kick drum hits. The omission of expected accents and the density of off-beat hits make it far more rhythmically complex and syncopated.

Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in a 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The main kick and snare pattern in each excerpt repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on the "and" of beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum hits on beat 2 and beat 4. The defining characteristic is the complete omission of the kick drum on the strong downbeats of 1 and 3; all kick hits are on off-beats.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum lands squarely on beat 1 and beat 3. The snare drum hits on the "and" of beat 1, the "and" of beat 2, and on beat 4. This pattern has off-beat snare accents, but the kick drum provides a very solid, on-beat foundation.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
While Excerpt 2 has multiple off-beat snare hits, its kick drum firmly anchors the rhythm on the strong beats 1 and 3. Excerpt 1 is fundamentally more syncopated because it displaces the entire rhythmic foundation. By completely omitting the expected kick drums on beats 1 and 3 and placing them exclusively on off-beats, it creates a much stronger sense of rhythmic tension and displacement from the main pulse. The omission of strong-beat accents in favor of off-beat ones is a key element of syncopation, and Excerpt 1 demonstrates this more profoundly.

Both excerpts are in a standard 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The main kick and snare pattern in each repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands squarely on beat 1 and beat 3. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. This is a fundamental, straight rock beat with all accents falling directly on the main beats. There are no off-beat kick or snare hits.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and on the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. This pattern is very similar to Excerpt 1, but it adds an extra kick drum hit on an off-beat.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 1 is the definition of a non-syncopated beat, as every kick and snare hit is on a strong beat (1, 2, 3, or 4). Excerpt 2 introduces one element of syncopation: the kick drum on the "and" of beat 2. Since Excerpt 1 has zero off-beat accents and Excerpt 2 has one, Excerpt 2 is the more syncopated rhythm.

Both excerpts are in a 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The main kick and snare pattern in both excerpts repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and beat 3. The snare drum hits on the "and" of beat 2 and squarely on beat 4. The syncopation comes from the snare on the "and" of 2, which displaces the expected backbeat from beat 2.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and on the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. The syncopation here is the extra kick drum hit on the "and" of 2.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Both rhythms feature one primary off-beat hit per measure. However, the nature of the syncopation is different. In Excerpt 2, all the main beats are articulated (kick on 1, snare on 2, snare on 4), and the syncopation is an *added* off-beat kick. In Excerpt 1, the strong backbeat on beat 2 is *omitted* and *replaced* by a snare hit on the subsequent off-beat. Displacing a strong, expected accent (the backbeat) creates a greater sense of rhythmic tension and syncopation than simply adding an extra off-beat hit while keeping all the main beats intact.

A. The rhythm in Excerpt 1 is more syncopated.

Step 1: Establish the pulse and smallest repeating cycle for each excerpt.
Both excerpts are in a 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat pulse. The main kick and snare pattern in each excerpt repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. This is a very common rock beat, anchored by the kick on 1 and snares on 2 and 4. The single off-beat kick on the "and" of 2 is the only syncopated element.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum hits on beat 1, the "and" of beat 2, and the "and" of beat 3. The snare drum hits only on beat 3. This pattern is highly syncopated because it completely avoids the standard backbeats on 2 and 4.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 1 contains one off-beat kick drum hit but otherwise reinforces the strong beats very clearly. Excerpt 2 is significantly more syncopated. It has multiple off-beat kick hits and, more importantly, it completely omits the expected snare accents on the backbeats (2 and 4), displacing the primary snare hit to the unconventional beat 3. This systematic avoidance of expected strong-beat accents in favor of off-beat hits and displaced accents creates a much higher degree of rhythmic tension.

- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum hits on beat 1, the "and" of beat 2, and the "and" of beat 3. The snare drum hits only on beat 3. This pattern contains two off-beat kick drum hits and completely avoids the standard snare backbeats on 2 and 4.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Excerpt 2 is the definition of a non-syncopated rhythm; it has no off-beat accents. Excerpt 1 is highly syncopated by comparison. It features multiple off-beat kick hits and, more significantly, it omits the expected snare accents on beats 2 and 4, displacing the main snare to the unconventional location of beat 3. This combination of off-beat hits and displacement of expected strong accents makes it far more syncopated.

Both excerpts are in a 4/4 time signature with a steady eighth-note hi-hat providing the pulse. The core kick and snare pattern in each excerpt repeats every measure.

Step 2: For each excerpt, note kick/snare placements relative to the beat grid.
- **Excerpt 1:** The kick drum lands on beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands squarely on beat 2 and beat 4. This is a very common and relatively straightforward beat with one primary off-beat element: the kick on the "and" of 2.
- **Excerpt 2:** The kick drum also lands on beat 1 and the "and" of beat 2. The snare drum lands on the "and" of beat 1, as well as on beats 2 and 4. This pattern contains the same syncopated kick as Excerpt 1 but adds another off-beat accent with the snare on the "and" of 1.

Step 3: Compare which excerpt exhibits more off-beat emphasis, displaced accents, or ties across beats — that excerpt is more syncopated.
Both rhythms are built on a similar foundation, but Excerpt 2 adds an extra layer of rhythmic complexity. Excerpt 1 has one off-beat kick. Excerpt 2 has that same off-beat kick *plus* an off-beat snare. By having a greater number of off-beat accents within the measure, Excerpt 2 creates a busier and more syncopated feel.
