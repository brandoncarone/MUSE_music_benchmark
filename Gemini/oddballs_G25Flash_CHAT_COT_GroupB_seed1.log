2025-09-05 20:54:47,935 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the monophonic note sequence for both audios.
Audio 1: C4, G4, F4, E4, D4, C4
Audio 2: C4, G4, F4, E4, D4, C4

Step 2: Align the two sequences and compare pitches.
All corresponding notes match exactly in pitch.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
Since all pitches match exactly at corresponding positions, there is no oddball present.

Yes, these are the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:54:47,935 - Parsed Final Answer: Yes, these are the same exact melody.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
Since all pitches match exactly at corresponding positions, there is no oddball present.

Yes, these are the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:55:46,847 - Parsed Final Answer: Yes, these are the same exact melody.

2025-09-05 20:55:57,931 - [COT/GroupB] Q10 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: Identify the monophonic note sequence for both audios.
Audio 1: D5, C5, Bb4, A4, G4, F4, E4, D4, C4
Audio 2: D5, C5, B4, A4, G4, F4, E4, D4, C4

Step 2: Align the two sequences and compare pitches.
- Note 1 (D5): Match
- Note 2 (C5): Match
- Note 3 (Bb4 in Audio 1 vs B4 in Audio 2): Mismatch. Audio 2 has a natural B, which is an oddball compared to the Bb in Audio 1.
- The remaining notes in the sequence match.

Step 3: Decision rule application.
Since at least one pitch (Bb4 vs B4) differs at a corresponding position, an oddball is present, and the melodies are not the same.

No, these are not the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:55:57,931 - Parsed Final Answer: No, these are not the same exact melody.
2025-09-05 20:55:57,931 - Evaluation: Correct
