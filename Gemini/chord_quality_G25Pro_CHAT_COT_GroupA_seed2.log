--- Question 1 ---

2025-09-07 20:38:24,958 - Stimulus: file=/Users/bcarone/PycharmProjects/GeminiAPI/stimuli/Abminor_Piano_120.wav
2025-09-07 20:38:34,020 - [COT/GroupA] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: I listened to the sustained chord and the subsequent arpeggiation.
Step 2: The interval between the first note (the root) and the second note of the arpeggio is a major third (an interval of four semitones). This gives the chord its characteristic bright or happy sound.

A. Major

Step 1: I listened to the sustained chord and the arpeggiated notes.
Step 2: The interval between the root (the first note of the arpeggio) and the third (the second note) is a minor third, which consists of three semitones. This interval gives the chord its characteristic "sad" or "darker" quality.
