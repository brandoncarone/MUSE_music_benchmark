Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1: This progression uses four chords per cycle. In the key of G major, the chords are E minor, G major, C major, and D major. Functionally, this is vi – I – IV – V.
- Excerpt 2: This progression also uses four chords per cycle. In the key of G major, the chords are G major, E minor, A minor, and D major. Functionally, this is I – vi – ii – V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Progression 1 is vi – I – IV – V.
- Progression 2 is I – vi – ii – V.
The two progressions differ in both the functions they use (IV vs. ii) and the order in which those functions appear.

Step 3: Decision rule.
Since both the harmonic functions and their order differ, the two excerpts do not contain the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:29:15,520 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 is in the key of C major. The chords follow the sequence C (I) – G (V) – Am (vi) – F (IV). The progression is I–V–vi–IV.
- Excerpt 2 is in the key of G major. The chords follow the sequence G (I) – D (V) – Em (vi) – C (IV). The progression is I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions.
- Both excerpts follow the exact same sequence of harmonic functions: I–V–vi–IV. They differ in key, tempo, and instrumentation, but the underlying functional structure is identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
Since the functional order matches perfectly across the cycle, the two excerpts contain the same chord progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:29:27,032 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 is a fast-paced heavy rock track. The progression, relative to a C major tonic, is Am (vi) – C (I) – G (V) – F (IV). The functional sequence is vi–I–V–IV.
- Excerpt 2 is a slow, clean electric guitar piece. The progression, relative to a G major tonic, is G (I) – D (V) – Em (vi) – C (IV). The functional sequence is I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: vi–I–V–IV
- Progression 2: I–V–vi–IV
While both progressions use the same set of four harmonic functions (I, V, vi, IV), their order is different. Excerpt 1 begins on the minor `vi` chord, while Excerpt 2 begins on the tonic `I` chord.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- The task requires the *order* of the harmonic functions to be the same. Since the order differs, they are not the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:30:06,491 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 is a piano-led piece. In the key of C major, the chords follow the sequence C major (I) – A minor (vi) – F major (IV) – G major (V). This is the classic "50s progression." The functional sequence is I–vi–IV–V.
- Excerpt 2 is a heavy rock piece. Although it uses the same four chords, the cycle begins on the minor chord. In the key of C major, the progression is A minor (vi) – C major (I) – G major (V) – F major (IV). The functional sequence is vi–I–V–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: I–vi–IV–V
- Progression 2: vi–I–V–IV
While both progressions utilize the same set of harmonic functions (I, IV, V, vi), their starting points and internal order are different. The task requires the order to be identical.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the order of the harmonic functions is different, the two excerpts do not contain the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:30:20,467 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 features a clean, arpeggiated electric guitar. Relative to a G major tonic, the progression is G (I) – D (V) – Em (vi) – C (IV). The functional sequence is I–V–vi–IV.
- Excerpt 2 is played on a strummed acoustic guitar. Relative to a G major tonic, the progression is also G (I) – D (V) – Em (vi) – C (IV). The functional sequence is I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both excerpts follow the identical sequence of harmonic functions: I–V–vi–IV. They differ in instrumentation, tempo, and performance style (arpeggiated vs. strummed), but the core harmonic structure is the same.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the functional order matches perfectly, the two excerpts contain the same chord progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:30:35,668 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

2025-09-07 15:30:50,389 - [COT/GroupA] Q8 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 is a funk piece. In the key of C major, the chords follow the sequence C (I) – Am (vi) – F (IV) – G (V). This is the classic "doo-wop" or "50s progression."
- Excerpt 2 is a keyboard pad piece. In the key of C major, the chords follow the sequence C (I) – G (V) – Am (vi) – F (IV). This is another extremely common pop progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: I–vi–IV–V
- Progression 2: I–V–vi–IV
While both progressions use the same four chords (I, V, vi, and IV), the order of the middle two chords is different. Excerpt 1 moves from vi to IV, whereas Excerpt 2 moves from V to vi.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the order of the harmonic functions is different, the two excerpts do not contain the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 15:30:50,389 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

2025-09-07 15:31:04,652 - [COT/GroupA] Q9 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression.
- Excerpt 1 is a soft rock piece. Relative to a G major tonic, the progression is G (I) – Em (vi) – Am (ii) – D (V). The functional sequence is I–vi–ii–V.
- Excerpt 2 is an anthemic rock piece. Relative to a C major tonic, the progression is C (I) – G (V) – Am (vi) – F (IV). The functional sequence is I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Progression 1: I–vi–ii–V
- Progression 2: I–V–vi–IV
The two progressions use different harmonic functions (ii vs. IV) and arrange the functions in a different order after the initial tonic chord.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since both the functions used and their order are different, the two excerpts do not contain the same chord progression.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
