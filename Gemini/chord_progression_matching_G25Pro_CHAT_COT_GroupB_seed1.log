2025-09-07 17:02:10,076 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1: The progression, relative to its tonic, is I–V–vi–IV. This cycle repeats.
- Excerpt 2: This progression, despite its different tempo and style, also follows a I–V–vi–IV pattern.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both excerpts use the same four harmonic functions: tonic (I), dominant (V), submediant (vi), and subdominant (IV).
- The order of these functions is identical in both excerpts: I, then V, then vi, then IV.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the functional order matches perfectly across the cycle (I–V–vi–IV), the two excerpts contain the same underlying chord progression. The differences in instrumentation, tempo, and rhythmic feel are superficial.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:02:10,076 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:02:10,076 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=B. No, these are not the same chord progression., prog1=I-IV-V, prog2=I-V-VI-IV)

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1: This excerpt features a progression that can be analyzed as I–V–vi–IV in a major key. The chords cycle in that specific order.
- Excerpt 2: This excerpt, played on electric guitar, uses a different but very common progression. The harmonic analysis reveals a cycle of vi–IV–I–V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both progressions use the same set of four chords (I, V, vi, IV).
- However, the order in which these chords appear is different. Excerpt 1 follows the sequence I–V–vi–IV, while Excerpt 2 follows the sequence vi–IV–I–V.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- According to the task rules, the ORDER of harmonic functions must be the same. Since the order differs between the two excerpts, they are not the same progression. They are different permutations of the same four chords.

B. No, these are not the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:02:23,790 - Parsed Final Answer: B. No, these are not the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1: This is a piano piece. The chords can be identified as A minor, G major, C major, and F major. Relative to the key of C major, this progression is vi–V–I–IV.
- Excerpt 2: This is an up-tempo rock piece. Despite the stylistic and instrumental differences, the underlying chords are the same: A minor, G major, C major, and F major. This also translates to a vi–V–I–IV progression in the key of C major.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both progressions use the same set of harmonic functions: vi, V, I, and IV.
- The order of these functions is identical in both excerpts: vi, then V, then I, then IV.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- Since the functional order matches perfectly (vi–V–I–IV), the two excerpts share the same underlying chord progression. The vast differences in tempo, instrumentation, and performance style are superficial in the context of this task.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

- Excerpt 2: This is a heavy rock/punk piece played with distorted guitars. Despite the drastically different style, the underlying chords follow the same sequence: C major, G major, A minor, and F major. This also corresponds to a I–V–vi–IV progression.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both excerpts use the same set of harmonic functions: I, V, vi, and IV.
- The order of these functions is identical in both excerpts: I → V → vi → IV.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm and abstract the progression as harmonic functions.
- Excerpt 1: This is a funk-style piece. Listening to the progression, we can identify the chords as C major, G major, A minor, and F major. Relative to the key of C major, this is a I–V–vi–IV progression.
- Excerpt 2: This is an up-tempo rock piece. The chords here are A minor, G major, C major, and F major. While it uses the same set of chords as Excerpt 1, the starting point and order are different. Relative to the key of C major, this progression is vi–V–I–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle.
- Both progressions use the same four chords (I, V, vi, IV).
- However, the order is different. Excerpt 1 follows the sequence I–V–vi–IV. Excerpt 2 follows the sequence vi–V–I–IV.

Step 3: Decision rule.
- According to the task rules, the ORDER of the harmonic functions must match. Since the order is different, these are not the same chord progression. They are different permutations of the same harmonic material.
