2025-09-05 19:09:56,141 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
The melodic line starts on a low note and consistently moves upwards, ending on the highest pitch of the phrase. This is a clear overall ascending motion.
C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)
2025-09-05 19:09:56,141 - Parsed Final Answer: C. Ascending (pitch raises over time)

The melody starts on a high pitch, descends to a low point around the middle of the excerpt, and then ascends back up, ending on a high pitch. This fall-then-rise motion creates an Inverted Arch shape.
B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)
2025-09-05 19:10:08,623 - Parsed Final Answer: B. Inverted Arch (descending and then ascending)

The melody begins on a low note, ascends scalewise to a clear peak in the middle of the excerpt, and then descends in a similar scalewise fashion to a low note. This rise-then-fall pattern is a classic example of an arch contour.
