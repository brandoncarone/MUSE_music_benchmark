2025-09-08 00:07:10,558 - [COT/GroupA] Q6 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The piece begins in what sounds like C major, with a clear C major chord and subsequent diatonic harmony.

Step 2: Around the 0:10 mark, the harmonic progression begins to shift. By 0:15, a new tonal center, A minor (the relative minor of C major), is clearly established and sustained. The chords and melodic contour strongly suggest A minor as the new home base, with cadential figures that reinforce this new key.

Step 3: The shift from C major to A minor is sustained for the latter half of the excerpt, establishing A minor as a new, stable tonal center. This constitutes a modulation.

A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:07:10,558 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
2025-09-08 00:07:10,558 - Expected Final Answer: A. Yes, a key modulation occurs.
