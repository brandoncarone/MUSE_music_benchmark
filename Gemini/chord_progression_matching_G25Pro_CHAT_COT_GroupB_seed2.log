2025-09-07 17:04:38,140 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm (where chords change) and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key (e.g., I–vi–ii–V), ignoring inversions and extensions.
- Excerpt 1 (Funk/Pop style): The progression can be analyzed in C major. The chords are C (I), G (V), Am (vi), and F (IV). The functional progression is I–V–vi–IV.
- Excerpt 2 (Rock/Metal style): The progression can be analyzed in G major. The chords are G (I), D (V), Em (vi), and C (IV). The functional progression is I–V–vi–IV.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle:
- Both progressions follow the exact same sequence of harmonic functions: I–V–vi–IV.

Step 3: Decision rule:
- The functional ORDER matches across the cycle, even though the key, instrumentation, tempo, and style are different. Therefore, the two excerpts contain the same chord progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:04:38,140 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:04:38,140 - Evaluation: Incorrect (expected=B. No, these are not the same chord progression., prog1=I-VI-II-V, prog2=I-VI-IV-V)

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm (where chords change) and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key (e.g., I–vi–ii–V), ignoring inversions and extensions.
- Excerpt 1: This is a jazz-style piece. Let's establish the key as Eb major. The progression is Ebmaj7 (I) -> Abmaj7 (IV) -> Fm7 (ii) -> Bb7 (V). This gives us the functional progression I–IV–ii–V.
- Excerpt 2: This is an up-tempo pop-rock piece. Let's establish the key as C major. The progression is C (I) -> F (IV) -> Dm (ii) -> G (V). This also gives us the functional progression I–IV–ii–V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle:
- Both progressions follow the exact same order of harmonic functions: I–IV–ii–V.

Step 3: Decision rule:
- The functional ORDER matches across the cycle. Although the excerpts differ in key (Eb vs. C), tempo, and instrumentation, their core harmonic structure is identical. Therefore, they represent the same chord progression.

A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.
2025-09-07 17:04:54,012 - Parsed Final Answer: A. Yes, these are the same chord progression.

Step 1: For each excerpt, segment by harmonic rhythm (where chords change) and abstract the progression as harmonic functions relative to its local key (e.g., I–vi–ii–V), ignoring inversions and extensions.
- Excerpt 1: This is a funk-style piece. If we establish the key as C major, the progression is C (I) -> G (V) -> Am (vi) -> F (IV). The functional order is I–V–vi–IV.
- Excerpt 2: This is a pop-rock style piece. If we establish the key as C major, the progression is C (I) -> F (IV) -> Dm (ii) -> G (V). The functional order is I–IV–ii–V.

Step 2: Compare the two progressions across one cycle:
- The first progression is I–V–vi–IV.
- The second progression is I–IV–ii–V.
- Although they use common diatonic chords, the set of chords (V and vi vs. IV and ii) and their order are different after the initial tonic chord.
