2025-09-08 04:27:48,747 - [COT/GroupB] Q1 - LLM Full Response:
Step 1: The steady pulse is established by the fast drumming.

Step 2: The guitar riff and the drum pattern create a strong accent every four beats. Counting along reveals a clear cycle of ONE-two-three-four, which is standard for this style of rock/metal music.

Step 1: The drums establish a very clear and steady pulse.

Step 2: The kick drum on beat 1 and the snare drum on beats 2 and 4 create a strong, repeating backbeat pattern. This structure is a hallmark of a four-beat cycle. Counting along as ONE-two-three-four feels natural and aligns with the phrasing of all the instruments.

Step 1: The drums and shaker provide a clear, steady pulse.

Step 2: The kick drum consistently lands on beat one, and the snare drum has a strong accent on beat three. This creates a repeating cycle of four beats: ONE-two-THREE-four. The harmonic and melodic phrases also resolve neatly within this four-beat grouping.

Step 1: A steady pulse is clearly established by the hip-hop style drum beat.

Step 2: The strong snare drum hits create a classic backbeat on beats 2 and 4. This pattern of accents defines a repeating cycle of four beats (ONE-**two**-three-**four**).

Step 1: The drums provide a very clear and steady pulse.

Step 2: The classic rock beat, with the kick drum on beat 1 and the snare drum providing a strong backbeat on beats 2 and 4, establishes a repeating cycle of four beats. The guitar chords also change in alignment with this four-beat pattern.

Step 1: A steady pulse is established by the drum machine.

Step 2: The kick drum on beats 1 and 3 and the snare on beats 2 and 4 create a classic backbeat pattern. The entire musical phrase repeats over this four-beat cycle.

Step 1: The pulse is clearly defined by the drums and the rhythmic strumming of the acoustic guitar.

Step 2: The drum pattern, with strong accents on the downbeats and backbeats, creates a recurring cycle of four beats. The chord progressions and musical phrases align with this four-beat structure. Counting ONE-two-three-four is the most natural way to follow the music.

Step 1: The electronic drums establish a fast, steady pulse.

Step 2: The classic dance beat pattern, with a strong snare/clap accent on beats 2 and 4, creates an undeniable repeating cycle of four beats. The bassline and synth phrases also align with this grouping.

Step 1: The drums, bass, and guitar establish a slow, steady pulse.

Step 2: The music has a distinct waltz-like feel. There is a strong accent on the first beat of each group, followed by two weaker beats. The drum pattern (kick on beat 1, snare on beat 3) and the harmonic rhythm strongly support a repeating cycle of three beats (ONE-two-three | ONE-two-three).
